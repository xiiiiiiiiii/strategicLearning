{"problem": "A list of five positive integers has mean $12$ and range $18$. The mode and median are both $8$. How many different values are possible for the second largest element of the list? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "answer": "6"}
{"problem": "A list of integers has mode 32 and mean 22. The smallest number in the list is 10. The median  m of the list is a member of the list. If the list member  m were replaced by  m+10, the mean and median of the new list would be 24 and  m+10, respectively. If  m were instead replaced by  m-8, the median of the new list would be  m-4. What is  m? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "answer": "20"}

{"problem": "Suppose that $k \\geq 2$ is a positive integer. An in-shuffle is performed on a list with $2 k$ items to produce a new list of $2 k$ items in the following way: - The first $k$ items from the original are placed in the odd positions of the new list in the same order as they appeared in the original list. - The remaining $k$ items from the original are placed in the even positions of the new list, in the same order as they appeared in the original list. For example, an in-shuffle performed on the list $P Q R S T U$ gives the new list $P S Q T R U$. A second in-shuffle now gives the list $P T S R Q U$. Ping has a list of the 66 integers from 1 to 66, arranged in increasing order. He performs 1000 in-shuffles on this list, recording the new list each time. In how many of these 1001 lists is the number 47 in the 24th position? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "answer": "83"}
