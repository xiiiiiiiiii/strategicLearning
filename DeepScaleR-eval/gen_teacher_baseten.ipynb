      "Okay, so I need to figure out the largest possible integer in this list of five positive integers given the constraints. Let me start by breaking down the problem and see how each condition affects the possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the problem states:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8. So, 8 is repeated at least twice, and all other numbers are unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The median is 9. Since there are five numbers, the third number when arranged in order must be 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The average is 10. Therefore, the total sum of all five numbers must be 50 (since 5 times 10 is 50).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal is to maximize the largest number in the list. To do that, I should try to minimize the other numbers as much as possible, while still adhering to the constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure the list in order: let's call the list [a, b, c, d, e]. Since the median is 9, the middle term c must be 9. So, c = 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, since the list is in non-decreasing order, a ≤ b ≤ 9 ≤ d ≤ e.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the only repeated number is 8. That means 8 must appear at least twice, but all others are distinct. So, 8 can't be in the list more than twice? Wait, the wording says \"the only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8.\" So, 8 occurs exactly twice, because it's the only one with duplicates, and the rest can occur once. So, two of the numbers are 8, and the others are all distinct. So, there are five numbers in total, two of which are 8 and the others three are different numbers, not repeating any except perhaps 8 again. Wait, but no, the rest can't repeat. Wait, actually, the wording says the only integer that occurs more than once is 8, so numbers other than 8 must occur exactly once. Therefore, exactly two 8's, and the other three are distinct numbers different from each other and from 8. So, total numbers: two 8's and three distinct numbers not being 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so that gives structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to have two 8s, three other distinct numbers, and the list must be arranged such that when sorted, the third is 9. Also, the sum is 50.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me note variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me first structure the sorted list. Since the median is 9, the third element is 9. The first two elements are less than or equal to 9, and the last two are greater than or equal to 9. Now, since the only duplicates are the two 8's, those two 8's have to be placed in the list in such a way that they don't create duplicates elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, notice that since the median is 9, the third number is 9. The two numbers before the median (a and b) must be ≤9, and the two after (d and e) must be ≥9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, since 8 occurs exactly twice, the duplicates can't be anywhere else except maybe in positions a and b, or perhaps one in a/b and the other in d/e? Hmm, but if we have 8 in d or e, then since those are >=9, which is not possible because 8 is less than 9. Therefore, the duplicate 8s have to be in positions a, b, or maybe even the third position is 9, but the duplicates cannot be at d or e. Wait, if the two 8s have to be duplicates, they must be in the first two positions, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait. Let me think again:\n",
      "\n",
      "We have two 8's. Since numbers are in non-decreasing order, if 8 is placed after the median, which is 9, that's impossible because numbers after the median must be at least 9. So, the two 8's must be in the first three positions. However, since the median is 9, which is the third element, so the third number is 9, so we can't have an 8 there. Hence, the two 8s must be in positions a or b.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the two 8s are either both in the first two positions, or one in b and the other in a. Alternatively, one in a, and one in b. So, for example, the first two numbers could be 8 and 8, and the third is 9, then the rest are >=9. Alternatively, maybe one of them is in a or b, but they can't be in d or e.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the case where one of the numbers is in the third position, but the third position is 9, so that can't be an 8. So two 8s must be in first and/or second positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So possible arrangements for the first three numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 1: Both a and b are 8. Then the first three numbers are [8, 8, 9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 2: One of them is 8, the other is higher? Wait, but no duplicates except for the two 8s. Since the problem states that the only number occurring more than once is 8. So if a is 8, then b could be a different number? But if so, then to have two 8's, we need another 8 either in a or b, or somewhere else? Wait but numbers after the median (position 3) can't be 8 because they have to be at least 9. So only positions 1,2 can have the duplicates (the two 8s). Since we need exactly two 8s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 1: [8,8,9,d,e]\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 2: [8, (something less than 9 but not 8),9,d,e] with an additional 8 in a or b, but if there's only one 8 in a then to have another 8, it would have to be in b. Therefore, to have two 8's, only possible to have both a and b as 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe there's another arrangement. Suppose one of the duplicates is in position a=8 and another in position b= something else, but that would require another 8 elsewhere except for d or e. Since d and e can't be 8.

      "Alternatively, what if two 8s are at positions 1 and 3?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the list would be [8, b,8, d, e]. But then sorted order would require that 8 ≤ b ≤8? But the third element must be the median, which is supposed to be 9. Wait that can't be, because if we have an 8 in the third position, the median would be 8, but the median must be 9. Therefore invalid.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the first numbers are 8,8,9, then the minimal d is 10, so e=15 is the maximum possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, unless there is another allocation of numbers where the two 8's are arranged differently?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, here's a different idea: Suppose that we have one of the numbers after the median as a number lower than 10, but that can't because they have to be ≥9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait actually, numbers after the median must be ≥ the median? Well, in non-decreasing order, yes. Therefore, d and e must be at least 9, but cannot be 9 except once. Since the third number is 9, d can be 10 or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if d=10 and e=15, sum is correct, so e=15 is the highest possible here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I have something like [8,8,9, 11,14], the e=14, so worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I tried to set d= something else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, what if I have three numbers after the median?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, positions a,b,c,d,e. After the median (position 3, which is 9), positions d and e are both greater or equal to 9? Wait, no, in a non-decreasing list, yes, since median is third, elements after must be ≥ median.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since 9 is already the median, all elements after must be ≥9, and since duplicates only allowed for 8, which are already placed in the first two spots, so numbers after must be integers from 10 upwards, distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, to maximize e, set d as small as possible. Therefore, 10 and 15 is the way to go.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "What if the list is [7,8,9,8, e]. Wait, but sorted order would require arrange them in order so that the two 8's are not at the end. Let me sort them properly:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the numbers were [7,8,8,9,e], when sorted it becomes [7,8,8,9,e]. Then median is third number, which is 8, but we need the median to be 9. So that's invalid.\n",

      "Wait let me try building such a list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try:\n",
      "\n",
      "First two numbers 7 and 8, but then that uses one 8, so need another. Suppose the list is [7,8,9, 8, 18]. But when sorted, it is [7,8,8,9,18]. Now:\n",

      "- Sorted list: 7,8,8,9,18\n",
      "\n",
      "- Median is third term, 8, which is not 9. Doesn't satisfy median requirement. So invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if we want the median to be 9, it must be the third number, so third number must be 9, so first three numbers must include the two 8s and the 9? Like [8,8,9], followed by d,e.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so indeed it seems that starting with two 8s and then 9 is the only way. Therefore, the list must be [8,8,9,d,e], hence the maximum possible e is 15.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively inserting another 8 in the fourth position:\n",

      "Wait no, fourth position needs to be at least 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait let me try with three numbers before the median? Wait, the median is the third number, so there are three numbers before? No, the third is the median. The first two must be before the median.\n",

      "But can't do better for e.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ah! Wait, here's an alternative arrangement where the two 8's are in first and third position. Wait, but no, when sorted, the third position must be the median, so that requires that after arranging in sorted order, the third is 9. Therefore, even if you have two 8s and a 9 in the first three positions, but you can't have an 8 after the third position.\n",
      "\n",

      "Hence, the conclusion must hold.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps three 8's? But the problem says the only number occurring more than once is 8. So it can occur twice or more. Wait, actually the problem says \"the only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8\"—it doesn't specify how many times it occurs. So could we have three 8's?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. Wait, if there were three 8s, that would still satisfy the problem's condition since it's the only number duplicated, but the question says \"the only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8\", which allows 8 to occur two or more times, but all others only once. So, three 8's would still fit the condition. However, that might allow another arrangement where you have three 8s, so maybe giving another option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's explore this possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose the list has three 8s instead of two. Let me see.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we have three 8's, they are the only duplicates. Then, the rest of the numbers are distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try that approach to see if it allows e to be larger.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, sorted list would be [8,8,8, d, e], but then the median is the third term, which would be 8, but we need the median to be 9. Therefore that's invalid. Thus can't have three 8s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the three 8s must be arranged so that the third element is 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "For example [8,8,9, 8,e], but when sorted becomes [8,8,8,9,e], median is third term which is 8. Thus invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, to have the median at nine, three 8's would require the third element to be 9, so there can't be three 8's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, only two duplicates of 8 is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, that approach won't help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so after considering all those approaches, I think the maximum possible number is 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence the answer is 15. I should check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait another Idea: Suppose that we have only one occurrence of 8 and having another duplicate? But no, the problem says \"the only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8\", meaning that 8 occurs at least two times, and exactly two times if that's what you choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, actually it could be three or more, but in such case, the median would not be nine, so as shown earlier three eight's make the median 8, which is invalid. Thus two eights are necessary to have the median at nine and satisfy all the conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, back to original arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, could the two eight's be placed in positions a and d? Wait, but d is after the median, so it must be at least nine. 8 is less than nine, so that's impossible.\n",

      "Is there a way to set d even lower than 10?\n",
