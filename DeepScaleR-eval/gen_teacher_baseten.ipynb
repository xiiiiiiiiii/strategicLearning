      "Okay, so I need to figure out the largest possible integer in this list of five positive integers given the constraints. Let me start by breaking down the problem and see how each condition affects the possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the problem states:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8. So, 8 is repeated at least twice, and all other numbers are unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The median is 9. Since there are five numbers, the third number when arranged in order must be 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The average is 10. Therefore, the total sum of all five numbers must be 50 (since 5 times 10 is 50).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal is to maximize the largest number in the list. To do that, I should try to minimize the other numbers as much as possible, while still adhering to the constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure the list in order: let's call the list [a, b, c, d, e]. Since the median is 9, the middle term c must be 9. So, c = 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, since the list is in non-decreasing order, a ≤ b ≤ 9 ≤ d ≤ e.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the only repeated number is 8. That means 8 must appear at least twice, but all others are distinct. So, 8 can't be in the list more than twice? Wait, the wording says \"the only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8.\" So, 8 occurs exactly twice, because it's the only one with duplicates, and the rest can occur once. So, two of the numbers are 8, and the others are all distinct. So, there are five numbers in total, two of which are 8 and the others three are different numbers, not repeating any except perhaps 8 again. Wait, but no, the rest can't repeat. Wait, actually, the wording says the only integer that occurs more than once is 8, so numbers other than 8 must occur exactly once. Therefore, exactly two 8's, and the other three are distinct numbers different from each other and from 8. So, total numbers: two 8's and three distinct numbers not being 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so that gives structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to have two 8s, three other distinct numbers, and the list must be arranged such that when sorted, the third is 9. Also, the sum is 50.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me note variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me first structure the sorted list. Since the median is 9, the third element is 9. The first two elements are less than or equal to 9, and the last two are greater than or equal to 9. Now, since the only duplicates are the two 8's, those two 8's have to be placed in the list in such a way that they don't create duplicates elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, notice that since the median is 9, the third number is 9. The two numbers before the median (a and b) must be ≤9, and the two after (d and e) must be ≥9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, since 8 occurs exactly twice, the duplicates can't be anywhere else except maybe in positions a and b, or perhaps one in a/b and the other in d/e? Hmm, but if we have 8 in d or e, then since those are >=9, which is not possible because 8 is less than 9. Therefore, the duplicate 8s have to be in positions a, b, or maybe even the third position is 9, but the duplicates cannot be at d or e. Wait, if the two 8s have to be duplicates, they must be in the first two positions, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait. Let me think again:\n",
      "\n",
      "We have two 8's. Since numbers are in non-decreasing order, if 8 is placed after the median, which is 9, that's impossible because numbers after the median must be at least 9. So, the two 8's must be in the first three positions. However, since the median is 9, which is the third element, so the third number is 9, so we can't have an 8 there. Hence, the two 8s must be in positions a or b.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the two 8s are either both in the first two positions, or one in b and the other in a. Alternatively, one in a, and one in b. So, for example, the first two numbers could be 8 and 8, and the third is 9, then the rest are >=9. Alternatively, maybe one of them is in a or b, but they can't be in d or e.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the case where one of the numbers is in the third position, but the third position is 9, so that can't be an 8. So two 8s must be in first and/or second positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So possible arrangements for the first three numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 1: Both a and b are 8. Then the first three numbers are [8, 8, 9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 2: One of them is 8, the other is higher? Wait, but no duplicates except for the two 8s. Since the problem states that the only number occurring more than once is 8. So if a is 8, then b could be a different number? But if so, then to have two 8's, we need another 8 either in a or b, or somewhere else?

      "Alternatively, what if two 8s are at positions 1 and 3?\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, here's a different idea: Suppose that we have one of the numbers after the median as a number lower than 10, but that can't because they have to be ≥9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait actually, numbers after the median must be ≥ the median? Well, in non-decreasing order, yes. Therefore, d and e must be at least 9, but cannot be 9 except once. Since the third number is 9, d can be 10 or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if d=10 and e=15, sum is correct, so e=15 is the highest possible here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I have something like [8,8,9, 11,14], the e=14, so worse.\n",

      "Wait, what if I have three numbers after the median?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, positions a,b,c,d,e. After the median (position 3, which is 9), positions d and e are both greater or equal to 9? Wait, no, in a non-decreasing list, yes, since median is third, elements after must be ≥ median.\n",

Wait no, since only duplicates allowed are 8s, the fourth and fifth numbers must be distinct and at least 10 or unique. Wait, actually, even if they are same but since the only number allowed to repeat is 8, so d and e must be distinct? Wait, even if they are same, that would create another duplicate, so they must be unique. Wait, not necessarily, because the problem states \"the only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8\". So if d and e are, say, 10 and another 10, that would be a duplication not allowed.
