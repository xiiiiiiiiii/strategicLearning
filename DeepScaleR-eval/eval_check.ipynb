      "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a list of positive integers with three properties. Let me try to parse each one and see what I can figure out step by step. Maybe after breaking it down, it'll all make sense. Okay, let's go.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the problem says: \"The sum of the items in the list is 30.\" That's straightforward. So if we denote the list as [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], where each ai is a positive integer, then a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an = 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next property: \"The unique mode of the list is 9.\" Hmm, mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's a unique mode, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number in the list. So in other words, the number of times 9 appears is greater than any other number's count. So if another number appears x times, 9 must appear at least x + 1 times? Wait, maybe not necessarily, but at least the number of times it appears is the highest. So since it's the unique mode, all other numbers must appear less frequently than the number of times 9 appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the third property: \"The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.\" Okay. So the median is defined as the middle value when the list is ordered. Since it's a positive integer, that gives us some constraint. Also, this median value doesn't appear in the list at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's list out these properties again:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sum of the list: 30.\n",
      "2. Unique mode is 9. So 9 is the only number that appears more frequently than any other number.\n",
      "3. Median is an integer not in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to find such a list and then compute the sum of the squares of all its items.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's try to model this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, since the mode is 9, and it's unique, meaning that the maximum frequency of any number is same as the frequency of 9. Wait, no: more accurately, the number 9 occurs more times than any other number. So all other numbers occur less times than 9. So perhaps 9 occurs at least two times more than any other number?\n",
      "\n",
      "But actually, since it's the unique mode, the number of occurrences of 9 is greater than the number of occurrences of any other number in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, let's denote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the list have n elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assume that n is the number of elements in the list. Then, since 9 is the mode, it appears more times than any other number. So for example, if we let k be the number of times 9 appears, then every other number appears at most k - 1 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the sum is 30. So all the numbers in the list, when added, equal 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the median is an integer not present in the list. So when we arrange the list in non-decreasing order, the middle term (or terms, if even) is equal to some integer m, which is not in the list. So m is not among the a_i's. Additionally, since m is an integer and a positive integer, m is at least 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the list must contain positive integers, so they start from 1 at minimum. However, since 9 is the mode, which is the highest number. If 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice because in some cases, the mode can be a single number if all other numbers appear once. Wait no, if a mode is a single number, then all other numbers appear only once or less, but if they are less than the mode's frequency. Wait, perhaps in this case, since it's the unique mode, maybe 9 appears more times than any other single occurrence? Hmm, perhaps this needs more careful thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me first consider how to model the list. Since the list has a sum of 30 and consists of positive integers, perhaps we can figure out possible configurations based on the constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, since 9 is the unique mode, let's try to figure out the minimal number of elements. Since mode is 9, at least two elements must be 9? Wait, no, perhaps one. Wait, no. Wait, if 9 appears once, but all other numbers appear once as well, meaning that no other number is in the list. But the problem states that the sum is 30, but in such a case, we'd have the list containing only 9s. Then, the sum would be 9*m = 30, but 30 isn't divisible by 9. So the list cannot consist solely of 9s. Hence, more carefully, perhaps let's see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps let's consider that since 9 is the unique mode, all other numbers must appear less frequently than 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. So for example, if 9 appears twice, then no other number can appear twice. Thus, all other numbers can appear at most once.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps more accurately, if the list contains 9 appearing m times, and every other number appears at most m - 1 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps the minimal number of times 9 appears is equal to the number of other unique numbers plus one? Hmm, perhaps not exactly, but that might be a way to think about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Since we have to construct a list with these properties, perhaps let's first try to figure out the number of elements in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 9 is the mode, let's denote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Number of times 9 appears: m.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each other number appears at most m - 1 times.\n",

      "Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to start by assuming a small number of elements and then see if the conditions hold. So perhaps let's think about possible n.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the median is an integer, it must be a number present in the list or not. But according to the third condition, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. Thus, if the median is m, then m is an integer, not in the list, and is the median.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps we can consider possible median values, m, such that m is an integer, not in the list.\n",

      "Additionally, since the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, and in our assumption it's not necessarily sorted. Wait, hold on. Wait, when we arrange the list in non-decreasing order, the first two elements are 9, and then the others are in order.\n",
