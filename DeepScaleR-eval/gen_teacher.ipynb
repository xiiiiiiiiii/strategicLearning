Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n",

      "First, let me recall that for a quadratic equation x² + px + q = 0, the sum of the roots is -p and the product is q. The discriminant is D = p² - 4q. The problem states that D must be positive, so the roots are real and distinct. Since p and q are divisible by 5, let me denote p = 5a and q = 5b where a and b are integers. Then the discriminant becomes D = (5a)² - 4*(5b) = 25a² - 20b. Since D must be positive, 25a² > 20b, or 5a² > 4b. Not sure if I need that yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key part is to find the sum of the hundredth powers of the roots. Let me denote the roots as r₁ and r₂. Then we need to compute S₁₀₀ = r₁¹⁰⁰ + r₂¹⁰⁰. The problem says that this S₁₀₀ must be divisible by 5ⁿ for all such polynomials, and we have to find the maximum n such that this holds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that for linear recursions, the sum of the powers of roots can be found using recurrence relations. Since the quadratic is x² + px + q, the recurrence relation for S_k = r₁^k + r₂^k is S_k = -p * S_{k-1} - q * S_{k-2}. Because of the coefficients p and q. Since p and q are multiples of 5, maybe this recurrence can help us find the divisibility properties?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me first check for the initial terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "S₀ = r₁⁰ + r₂⁰ = 1 + 1 = 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, when k=0, S₀ is 2, right? Since r₁ and r₂ are roots, but maybe I should verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, S₀ is the sum of the roots^0, which is 1 + 1 = 2, yes. But actually, in the recurrence relation, S₀ should be defined as 2. Then S₁ = r₁ + r₂ = -p (since sum of roots is -p). Wait, but according to the quadratic equation, sum of roots is -p, so S₁ = -p. Similarly, S₂ = (r₁ + r₂)^2 - 2r₁r₂ = (S₁)^2 - 2q = (-p)^2 - 2q.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Similarly, S₃ can be computed via the recurrence: S₃ = -5a S₂ -5b S₁. Since S₂ is divisible by 5 and S₁ is divisible by 5, so S₃ is divisible by 5*(5a * (something) + b*(something else)). Hmm, but maybe a better way is to see how the powers of 5 increase with each step.\n",

But since a can be any integer, so the minimal exponent here is 1. Since we need the minimal exponent over all possible polynomials, so n must be such that it's the minimal exponent across all cases, but the problem says \"for any polynomial with the described properties\", so the n must be such that for every such polynomial, 5ⁿ divides S₁₀₀. Therefore, the maximal such n is the minimal number of times 5 divides S₁₀₀ over all possible such polynomials.\n",

The term 5a² - 2b may or may not be divisible by 5. For example, if 2b is divisible by 5, then 5a² -2b is divisible by 5, making S₂ divisible by 5². If not, it's only divisible by 5. But since b can be any integer, in the worst case, when 5 divides 2b? Since 2 and 5 are coprime, so 2b ≡0 mod5 iff b ≡0 mod5. If b is not divisible by 5, then 5a² -2b can be not divisible by 5, so S₂ would be divisible by 5 but not necessarily 5². Hence, the minimal exponent here would be 1? Wait, but since the problem says \"for any polynomial\", so we need the minimal exponent over all possible polynomials. So for S₂, if there exists a polynomial where S₂ is divisible by 5 but not 25, then the minimal exponent is 1, hence the overall n would have to be 1 for S₂, but since S₁ is divisible by 5, but S₀ isn't.\n",

      "5a² - 2b mod 5: 5a² mod5 is 0, so 5a² -2b ≡ -2b mod5. Since b is an integer, unless -2b ≡0 mod5, which requires b ≡0 mod5/ gcd(2,5)=1. So unless b is a multiple of 5/ gcd(2,5)=1, so if b is arbitrary, then 5a² -2b can be congruent to -2b mod5. Since b can be any integer divisible by 5 or not? Wait, no, q =5b, but the problem states that q must be divisible by 5, but there is no restriction on b being a multiple of 5. Wait, but b can be any integer. Wait, actually q must be divisible by 5, which is given, so q =5b, so b can be any integer, since 5b covers all multiples of 5. So b can be any integer. Therefore, when we look at S₂, the expression (5a² -2b) can have any residue mod5, depending on b. For example, if I set a=0, then S₂ becomes -10b. If a=0, then the polynomial would be x² +0x +5b =x² +5b, so discriminant D =0² -4*5b = -20b. But wait, the discriminant has to be positive, so D must be positive. Wait, hold on, the discriminant is p² -4q = (5a)^2 -4*(5b)=25a² -20b. To have D positive, we need 25a² -20b >0. So even if a=0, then discriminant would be -20b. But then this is positive only if b is negative. Wait, but b is an integer, so if a=0, then discriminant is -20b >0 implies that b <0. However, the problem allows q to be any multiple of 5, so b can be negative. But even so, in such cases, S₂ when a=0, S₁ =0 (since a=0) so S₁=0. Then S₂= -5a S₁ -5b S₀ = -0 -5b*2 = -10b. Since b can be any integer, so S₂ can be any multiple of 10. So for example, if b is 1, then S₂ = -10*1 = -10, which is divisible by 5¹, but not 5². So the minimal exponent here is 1? Wait, but 10 is divisible by 5¹, so in that case, S₂ could be divisible by 5 but not 25, so the minimal exponent for S₂ is 1.\n",

So the second term has v₅ at least 1. The total S₂ = 25a² -10b. The minimal v₅(S₂) is the minimal between the exponents of the terms, but when subtracting, it's a bit more complicated. To find the minimal possible exponent for S₂, we can set the terms such that they reduce the exponent. For example, to make S₂ divisible only by 5^1, we need 25a² -10b ≡0 mod5 but not mod25. Let's set a=0. Then S₂ = -10b. If we set b=1 (so that q=5*1=5), then S₂= -10*1= -10, which is 5^1* (-2), so v₅(S₂)=1. So indeed, possible for S₂ to be divisible only by 5^1. So the minimal exponent for S₂ is 1, so n cannot be higher than 1 for S₂, but in other cases it's higher. Therefore, for S₂, minimal v₅(S₂)=1.
