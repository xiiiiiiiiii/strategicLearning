       "'Alright, let\\'s see. I need to create a Python function that generates a random practice problem similar to the original AIME problem mentioned. The problem should require finding the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of k, m, and n consecutive integers, similar to the original which used 9, 10, and 11. The solution must be a finite decimal (which probably just means an integer here, but maybe a multiple of some number). \\n\\nFirst, let\\'s think about how the original problem worked. The key steps involved expressing the number as sums of consecutive integers in three different ways, each converted into an equation. For example, for nine consecutive integers starting at a: sum = 9a + 36, and similarly for the others. Then, setting these equal allows you to set up congruencies and solve using LCM and CRT.\\n\\nThe generated problem needs to follow a similar structure but with different numbers. So the procedure would be:\\n\\n1. Choose three different consecutive integer counts (k, m, n). Let\\'s say they are all between 3 and 20, maybe. They need to be positive integers.\\n\\n2. For each of these counts (say, k, m, n), the sum of those consecutive integers starting at some variable (like a, b, c) will form equations. The sum formulas for consecutive integers are known: sum = (number_of_terms/2)*(2*first_term + (terms-1)). Alternatively, the original used a simpler formula: for k terms starting at a, it\\'s k*a + (k*(k-1))/2.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the equations would be of the form:\\n   N = k * a + (k*(k-1))/2\\n   N = m * b + (m*(m-1))/2\\n   N = n * c + (n*(n-1))/2\\n\\nEach of these equations can be rewritten to set up relationships between variables. But the key is that when we set them equal (since they all equal N), we can derive congruence relations or other constraints similar to the original problem.\\n\\nHowever, to ensure that there exists a solution, we might need to adjust the parameters so that when forming the equations, the system is solvable. Alternatively, maybe we can randomize the three numbers and then compute N based on that, then reverse engineer the problem. Alternatively, perhaps generate parameters such that N must satisfy certain congruences modulo k, m, n or things like that.\\n\\nBut the main goal is to create a problem where the solution exists and is the smallest such integer, similar to the original problem.\\n\\nSo the function needs to choose random integers k, m, n, generate the equations, then compute the minimal N that satisfies all three expressions. Since each equation can be written as N ≡ something mod something else, like in the original solution steps.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can pick k, m, n first. Then, compute the required congruencies for N, then find the minimal N that meets those congruencies. If such an N exists then proceed, else try again.\\n\\nWait, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe the function can generate three different numbers (k, m, n) of consecutive terms, then compute the required value N based on those parameters, such that N is the LCM of some numbers or something. Alternatively, set up congruency equations so that the minimal N can be determined by solving those.\\n\\nAlternatively, the approach for generating such a problem would involve:\\n\\n- Choose three integers k, m, and l (since the original was 9,10,11; perhaps three different numbers between maybe 5 and 15).\\n\\n- For each sequence length (let\\'s say k, m, n), express N as:\\n\\nN = a*k + (k*(k-1)/2)\\n\\nSimilarly, N = b*m + (m*(m-1))/2\\n\\nN = c*n + (n*(n-1))/2\\n\\nHere, a, b, c are the starting integers for each sequence.\\n\\nSo setting them all equal:\\n\\na*k + (k(k-1)/2) = b*m + (m(m-1)/2) = c*n + (n(n-1)/2)\\n\\nThen rearranged:\\n\\na = (N - (k(k-1)/2)) / k\\n\\nSimilarly for b and c.\\n\\nThe problem is that the problem must have a solution (i.e., there exists integers a, b, c that are non-negative? Or maybe just integers? If so, then the problem requires N to be such that:\\n\\nFirst, the terms (N - (k(k-1)/2)) must be divisible by k,\\n\\n(N - (m(m-1)/2)) must be divisible by m,\\n\\nand similarly for n.\\n\\nThus, for such N to exist, N must satisfy congruences:\\n\\nN ≡ (k(k-1)/2) mod k,\\n\\nN ≡ (m(m-1)/2) mod m,\\n\\nN ≡ (n(n-1)/2) mod n.\\n\\nThe minimal N that satisfies all three congruences will be the answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem\\'s solution can be found by solving those congruence equations, using Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), etc.\\n\\nThus, the task is to pick three numbers k, m, n, then compute the minimal N that satisfies those congruencies. If such N exists and N is at least the max of the required terms (like in the original problem, it\\'s possible that N has to be big enough for the starting terms to be positive integers. But perhaps the problem allows a,b,c to be negative as well as consecutive integers can be negative. Wait, the problem says \"positive integer\", but the starting terms can be negative integers. So maybe it\\'s okay; the problem only requires the sum itself to be the smallest positive.\\n\\nThus, the steps for generating the problem are:\\n\\n1. Pick three different integers k, m, n. Maybe between 3 and 20.\\n\\n2. Make sure that the congruencies can have a solution. For example, that the moduli are pairwise coprime for ease? Not sure. Let\\'s think better.\\n\\nAlternatively, compute the congruences for each of the terms.\\n\\nFor example, for the congruence with modulus k:\\n\\nThe equation is N ≡ (k(k-1)/2 mod k) mod k.\\n\\nLet me compute that term.\\n\\nThe expression (k(k-1)/2) modulo k:\\n\\nLet\\'s see, since k divides k(k-1), so the numerator is k*(k-1), so divided by 2. So (k*(k-1)/2) mod k.\\n\\nWait, let me compute term for k:\\n\\nLet\\'s write it as [ (k(k-1)/2) ] mod k.\\n\\nIf I factor out the k, then that term is [k*(k-1)/2], so modulo k, the k is a multiple, so:\\n\\nModulo k, this term is 0. Wait: wait, no. Wait, term is:\\n\\nWait, N must be congruent to (k(k-1)/2) mod k.\\n\\nBut let\\'s see:\\n\\nWait, (k*(k-1)/2) mod k ?\\n\\nLet me compute:\\n\\nFor example, if k is even:\\n\\nLet’s suppose k is even. Let k=4. Then (4*3)/2 = 6. mod 4: 6 mod4 is 2.\\n\\nSo congruence for N mod4 would have N ≡ 2 mod4?\\n\\nWait, but perhaps this can be simplified. Let me think about the general case:\\n\\nLet me note that k(k-1)/2 mod k.\\n\\nLet me write (k^2 -k)/2 mod k.\\n\\nWhich is (0 -k)/2 mod k → (-k)/2 mod k.\\n\\nThus, equivalently, this is (-k/2) modk.\\n\\nBut mod k, (-k/2) is equivalent to ( (k - (k/2) )) modk → same as k/2 modk? Wait no, maybe not. Wait let me see.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps it\\'s easier to see:\\n\\nLet me take the value:\\n\\nk(k-1)/2 = (k² - k)/2.\\n\\nThe term (k(k-1))/2 mod k.\\n\\nBut since k divides into k² term, so mod k this is (-k)/2 modk.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n( ( -k ) /2 ) modk → => same as ( -k/2 mod k )\\n\\nWhich is same as ( (k/2) ) mod k (but with a negative sign).\\n\\nWait, perhaps:\\n\\nWait if k is even, then let\\'s say k=2a.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n- (2a)/2 mod 2a → -a mod 2a → which is equal to a mod 2a?\\n\\nWait, that\\'s exactly what\\'s happening when k=4 (2a=4, so a=2 → mod4, the value would be 2.\\n\\nIndeed, for k=4, (k(k-1)/2) modk is (4*3/2=6 mod4= 2. So that\\'s indeed (k/2).\\n\\nWait so that term becomes ( - (k/2) ) modk?\\n\\nAlternatively, let me see when k is even vs odd.\\n\\nSuppose k is even:\\n\\nLet k=2p.\\n\\nThen, the term is (2p*(2p-1))/2 → (2p(2p-1))/2 → p*(2p -1). Then modulo 2p.\\n\\nCompute that:\\n\\np*(2p -1) mod 2p → p*( -1 ) mod 2p → -p mod2p → which is same as (2p - p) mod2p → p mod2p.\\n\\nWhich equals p. \\n\\nSo mod 2p is p → so congruence is N ≡ p mod 2p. Wait but that would mean mod 2p?\\n\\nWait no, the equation was set as modk (which is even k here, so k=2p).\\n\\nThus, the congruence is N ≡ p modk?\\n\\nWait that\\'s right. \\n\\nAlternatively, when k is even: \\nk(k-1)/2 modk = k mod mod k? Wait:\\n\\nWait let me compute for k=6: (6*5)/2=15 → mod6 gives 3.\\n\\n6 is 2p → p=3 → which gives 3 mod6, which matches.\\n\\nHmm okay. So when k is even, the congruence is N ≡ (k/2) modk.\\n\\nIf k is odd:\\n\\nLet me try k=3.\\n\\n3*2/2 =3 mod3 → 3 mod3 is 0.\\n\\nWait so N mod3 must be 0?\\n\\nIf k=5:\\n\\n5*4/2=10 mod5= 0 mod5.\\n\\nAh! So for odd k:\\n\\n(k is odd → suppose k is odd.\\n\\nThen k(k-1)/2 modk ?\\n\\nLet me write term as (k(k-1)/2). Let’s see if k divides into (k-1)/2?\\n\\nNot sure. Let me see:\\n\\nWait when k is odd, then (k-1) is even, so (k-1)/2 is an integer. Wait so:\\n\\nWe have (k*(k-1)/2) modk → [ (k terms divisible by k)* ( (k-1)/2) ] → no, better to see:\\n\\n(k*(k-1)/2) modk = [ (k modk)* ( (k-1)/2 mod (k/k )) ] → not sure.\\n\\nAlternative:\\n\\nNotice that when k is odd:\\n\\nLet’s suppose k=5:\\n\\nThe term is (5*4)/2 =10, mod5 gives 0. \\n\\nSimilarly for k=3 → 3 mod3=0.\\n\\nSo the congruence would N modk ≡0.\\n\\nWait, so:\\n\\nIf k is even: N ≡ (k/2) modk.\\n\\nIf k is odd: N ≡0 modk.\\n\\nThis is an important simplification.\\n\\nThus, the congruence equations become:\\n\\nFor each term length ki (each of k,m,n):\\n\\nIf ki is even, then N ≡ ki/2 mod ki.\\n\\nIf ki is odd, then N≡0 modki.\\n\\nSo the problem reduces to solving this system of congruent equations, as given by the chosen ki\\'s (k,m,n).\\n\\nThus, the minimal N will be the LCM-based solution given these conditions.\\n\\nSo the method for generating the problem would be:\\n\\nPick three distinct integers (k, m, n). For each, compute the modulo condition (depending on even or odd), then solve the congruences to find the smallest N. Then construct the problem: \"What is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of k consecutive integers, the sum of m consecutive integers, and the sum of n consecutive integers?\" And the solution is that minimal N.\\n\\nNow, the challenge is implementing a Python function that does this.\\n\\nFirst, steps for the code:\\n\\nFunction generate_problem():\\n\\nParameters:\\nWe need to generate three distinct integers for k, m, n. Let\\'s pick numbers between say 2 and 20, inclusive. They must be integers, distinct, since otherwise if two are same, the problem might be trivial? Or maybe it\\'s acceptable but the problem specifies three different counts.\\n\\nThen, compute the required congruence conditions for each.\\n\\nThen, compute the minimal N that satisfies all congruences.\\n\\nFirst, choosing k, m, n:\\n\\nWe can randomly select three different numbers between 2 and 20. But to ensure that the congruencies have a solution, we probably want their moduli to be compatible. However, maybe given the congruence conditions, it\\'s generally possible. For example, even and odd combinations.\\n\\nBut maybe sometimes the congruences will conflict. Like if two congruences require impossible values mod their gcd. Let me think:\\n\\nSuppose two modulus have GCD that does not divide the difference between the congruence terms.\\n\\nFor instance, suppose we have k=4 (congruence mod4 N≡ 2 mod4)\\n\\nand m=6 (congruence mod6 N ≡3 mod6).\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nN ≡2 mod4.\\n\\nN ≡3 mod6.\\n\\nLet me see: possible?\\n\\nLet’s see: N mod4 is 2 → possible values: 2,6,10,14,...\\n\\nCheck mod6 for those.\\n\\nCheck 2 mod6: 2 → 2 mod6, but need congruence mod6 to be 3 mod6 → so no.\\n\\n6 mod6 is 0 → no.\\n\\n10 mod6 is 4 → no.\\n\\n14 mod6 is 2 → no.\\n\\n22 mod4 is 2: 22 mod6 is 4 → no.\\n\\nHmm. This combination would not have any solution.\\n\\nThus, such a trio could be problematic. Therefore, when generating the numbers, perhaps I should loop until three ki are selected that allow a solution?\\n\\nAlternatively, in the problem generation, just choose them randomly and then compute the solution. But if there is no solution (i.e., the congruences are incompatible), then perhaps loop again until you find a good trio where a solution exists.\\n\\nThus the code needs a function to check whether the congruence equations have a solution, then compute N.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps most trios will have solutions, so we can just proceed with random choices and loop until a problem which has a solution is found. Probably better to code that, otherwise it might take a long time to find a trio with solution.\\n\\nAlternatively, set parameters in such a way that solution exists. For example, require that for any congruence pair, their conditions are compatible mod the GCD of their modulus etc.\\n\\nHmm, but that might be complicated.\\n\\nAlternatively, proceed as follows:\\n\\nInside a loop:\\n\\n- Choose three different random ki between, say, 2 and 20.\\n\\n- Create the congruence conditions as per even/odd rules.\\n\\n- Compute whether there is a simultaneous solution for all congruences modulo their respective ki.\\n\\n- If there exists a solution, compute the minimal N via CRT and return the problem.\\n\\nProceed until success.\\n\\nThus, need a helper function to compute the minimal N that satisfies all the congruences.\\n\\nLet me think about implementing the congruence solving:\\n\\nLet me denote for each ki:\\n\\nThe congruence is N ≡ c mod ki, where c is:\\n\\nif ki is even → c = ki//2 mod ki,\\n\\nelse → c=0.\\n\\nThus, the system is:\\n\\nN ≡ c1 mod k1\\n\\nN ≡ c2 mod k2\\n\\nN ≡ c3 mod k3.\\n\\nTo check if there is a solution, the Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that solutions exist iff, for any pair, the congruences agree modulo the GCD of their moduli.\\n\\nThus, to check for all pairs of congruences, for each pair (k_i, k_j) with moduli ki and kj, and congruence conditions:\\n\\nc1 ≡ c2 mod GCD(ki,kj).\\n\\nIf that holds for all pairs, then there exists a solution. Thus, the code can proceed as:\\n\\nFirst, compute the three congruence equations, then check pairwise compatibility.\\n\\nWait implementing this could be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\\n\\nAlternatively, proceed to try to compute the minimal N via CRT, and if that fails, discard those ki\\'s.\\n\\nAlternatively, code a function solve_congruences that takes a list of mod, rem pairs and returns the minimal N or None.\\n\\nAlternatively, given the constraints here (only 3 congruences), I can implement a custom CRT step for these three cases.\\n\\nAlternatively, since N has to satisfy all three congruences,\\n\\nthe first step is to compute the system step by step:\\n\\nLet’s first combine first two congruences:\\n\\nSay:\\n\\nN ≡ a mod mod1,\\n\\nN ≡ b mod mod2,\\n\\nFind a solution for that, then combine with third.\\n\\nAlternatively, proceed step by step.\\n\\nAlternatively, compute the minimal N via loops.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the Chinese Remainder Theorem\\'s algorithm.\\n\\nBut perhaps for code brevity, using the sympy module\\'s crt function would be better, but assuming the problem wants code without external libraries, perhaps we need to implement basic CRT.\\n\\nWait, but in the code, we can\\'t use sympy if the user expects plain Python.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows using the built-in functions, but otherwise, need to code.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the code is for a problem generator, and the user wants it to run without external modules, perhaps better to implement a simple CRT function.\\n\\nAlternatively, proceed with the following steps:\\n\\nSuppose we have the three congruence equations.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s find N such that:\\n\\nN ≡ c1 mod k1,\\n\\nN ≡ c2 mod k2,\\n\\nN ≡ c3 mod k3.\\n\\nNow, I can implement step-wise:\\n\\nStart combining first two congruences, then combine with third.\\n\\nWe can implement the step-by-step CRT.\\n\\nLet me write the steps.\\n\\nSuppose we first solve equation1 and equation2:\\n\\nLet equation1: x ≡ a mod m,\\n\\nequation2: x ≡ b mod n.\\n\\nTo find x ≡ ? mod lcm(m,n),\\n\\nCheck gcd(g, m) divides (a-b).\\n\\nWait, standard approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the algorithm described here:\\n\\nhttps://brilliant.org/wiki/chinese-remainder-theorem/\\n\\nThus, the way to compute the solution step by step.\\n\\nThus, to make this manageable, perhaps code a helper function that takes a list of (modulus, remainder), and returns either the minimal solution or None if no solution.\\n\\nLet\\'s design that function.\\n\\nOkay, let me try writing it.\\n\\nInside the helper:\\n\\ndef solve_congruence(mod_rem):\\n    # mod_rem is a list of tuples [(m1, r1), (m2, r2), (m3, r3)]\\n    # returns minimal N or None if no solution\\n    # stepwise: combine first two equations, then combine result with third\\n    n = len(mod_rem)\\n    if n == 0:\\n        return 0  # trivial case\\n    \\n    # initialize with first congruence\\n    current_mod, current_rem = mod_rem[0]\\n    for i in range(1, n):\\n        m2, r2 = mod_rem[i]\\n        # find x ≡ current_rem mod current_mod\\n        # and x ≡ r2 mod m2\\n        # find the new combined congruence if possible\\n        # we need to solve for x = current_rem + k*current_mod\\n        # and x ≡ r2 mod m2 → current_rem +k*current_mod ≡ r2 mod m2 → k*current_mod ≡ (r2 - current_rem) mod m2\\n        \\n        # this is a linear congruence in k: (current_mod)*k ≡ (r2 - current_rem) mod m2\\n        \\n        a = current_mod\\n        c = r2 - current_rem\\n        m = m2\\n        \\n        # solve a *k ≡ c mod m\\n        \\n        # find solutions for k. To do this, check if gcd(a,m) divides c\\n        g = math.gcd(a, m)\\n        if c % g !=0:\\n            return None\\n        # reduce equation to (a/g)*k ≡ (c/g) mod (m/g)\\n        a1 = a//g\\n        c1 = c//g\\n        m1 = m//g\\n        \\n        # find inverse of (a1 mod m1) if possible\\n        # a1 and m1 are coprime now\\n        inv = modular_inverse(a1, m1)\\n        if inv is None: # but since they are coprime, inverse exists. Thus should return\\n            return None\\n        \\n        k0 = (c1 * inv) % m1\\n        # so solutions for k are k0 + t*m1\\n        \\n        # so the minimal solution is x = current_rem +k0 * current_mod\\n        new_rem = current_rem + k0 * current_mod\\n        new_mod = current_mod * m //g\\n        \\n        # but need to make sure new_rem mod new_mod is correct?\\n        \\n        current_mod = new_mod\\n        current_rem = new_rem % current_mod # just to keep within mod\\n        \\n    return current_rem\\n\\nWait, but I think this is a start. We need a modular inverse function.\\n\\nImplementing modular inverse for coprime a and m can be done via extended Euclidean algorithm.\\n\\nAlternatively, here\\'s a function to compute modular inverse:\\n\\ndef modular_inverse(a, m):\\n    # returns the inverse of a mod m. if gcd(a,m)!=1, returns None\\n    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, m)\\n    if g !=1:\\n        return None\\n    else:\\n        return x % m\\n    \\nImplementing extended_gcd:\\n\\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\\n    if a ==0:\\n        return (b,0,1)\\n    else:\\n        g, y, x = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\\n        return (g, x - (b//a)*y, y)\\n\\nSo putting together, the solve_congruence function, given a list of modulus, remainder pairs, computes the smallest solution.\\n\\nThus, putting all together, here\\'s the plan.\\n\\nThe generate_problem function:\\n\\ndef generate_problem():\\n\\n    while True:\\n        # randomly choose 3 distinct integers between 2 and 20\\n        k = random.randint(2,20)\\n        m = random.randint(2,20)\\n        n = random.randint(2,20)\\n        # shuffle the three and pick first three until distinct?\\n        # actually better to ensure distinct first.\\n        \\n        distinct = set([k,m,n])\\n        while len(distinct) !=3:\\n            k,m,n = [random.randint(2,20) for _ in range(3)]\\n            distinct = set([k,m,n])\\n        \\n        klist = [k,m,n]\\n        \\n        # create list of congruence equations.\\n        congruences = []\\n        for term in klist:\\n            if term %2 ==0:\\n                # even, remainder term//2 mod term\\n                rem = term//2\\n            else:\\n                rem = 0\\n            congruences.append( (term, rem) )\\n        \\n        # now solve this system for N\\n        # using solve_congruence function\\n        solution = solve_congruence(congruences)\\n        if solution is None:\\n            continue # try again with different k,m,n\\n        else:\\n            min_N = solution\\n            # check if the minimal N is positive, which it should be.\\n            # Now, to form the problem:\\n            problem = f\"What is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of {k} consecutive integers, the sum of {m} consecutive integers, and the sum of {n} consecutive integers?\"\\n            return (problem, str(min_N))\\n\\nWait but there\\'s an issue when the solution N is small enough that the starting numbers could be negative. For example, in the original problem, the answer was 495 which was okay. \\n\\nBut in some cases, maybe the minimal solution is zero or negative, but the problem states \"smallest positive integer\".\\n\\nWell, the congruence solution gives a solution modulo LCM of the moduli, which could be negative. But solve_congruence function returns the smallest positive solution?\\n\\nWait, the solve_congruence function returns current_rem % current_mod ?\\n\\nHmm. In the code I wrote above, when constructing the new_rem, we have:\\n\\nnew_rem = current_rem + k0 * current_mod\\n\\nthen, current_rem is kept as new_rem mod current_mod (current_mod after iteration)\\n\\nWait, in the current code, the function would return current_rem, which should be the minimal non-negative solution. So positive.\\n\\nTherefore, as long as the initial congruence equations can be satisfied, the returned min_N will be the minimal positive solution.\\n\\nThus, if the solve_congruence returns a solution, then that works.\\n\\nHence, this code loops until it finds a trio (k, m, n) such that the congruence system has a solution, then returns the problem and solution.\\n\\nBut need to implement the helper functions.\\n\\nNow, also adding unit tests via brute-force method, but how?\\n\\nAlternatively, for testing:\\n\\nTake the generated problem, and check that N can indeed be written as the required sums.\\n\\nTo do this, for each of the three terms k, m, n:\\n\\nFor example, check whether there exists an integer a where:\\n\\nN = a *k + (k*(k-1)/2)\\n\\nWe can solve for a: a = (N - (k*(k-1)/2))/k → must be an integer.\\n\\nSimilarly for other coefficients. So in the unit test, verifying this.\\n\\nSo to generate a problem via the function, then, for the returned solution, check each term.\\n\\nNow, the code.\\n\\nWait implementing all this in Python requires writing these helper functions.\\n\\nNow, let me code the helper functions first.\\n\\nFull code structure:\\n\\nImplement the modular_inverse, extended_gcd, solve_congruence functions as helper functions.\\n\\nThen the generate_problem function.\\n\\nTesting with unit tests (small set of test runs to assert correctness).\\n\\nWait here\\'s the plan.\\n\\nBut in code, the helpers are needed first.\\n\\nLet\\'s write all that.\\n\\nWait, but here\\'s a potential problem. In the congruence equations:\\n\\nFor example, when k is even:\\n\\nThe congruence equation for modulus k is N ≡ (k/2) mod k.\\n\\nWhen k is odd:\\n\\nIt\\'s N ≡0 modk.\\n\\nThus, the congruences are set correctly.\\n\\nThus, in the congruence list:\\n\\nFor each ki (k, m, n):\\n\\nif even:\\n\\nmodulus ki, remainder (ki//2)\\n\\nelse:\\n\\nmodulus ki, remainder 0\\n\\nThus, in the congruences variable.\\n\\nThen, solve_congruence is called with that list.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo the code outline is:\\n\\nImplement all the helper functions.\\n\\nNow, moving to code:\\n\\nLet me write the code piece by piece.\\n\\nFirst, the modular_inverse function:\\n\\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\\n    if a == 0:\\n        return (b, 0, 1)\\n    else:\\n        g, y, x = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\\n        return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)\\n\\ndef modular_inverse(a, m):\\n    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, m)\\n    if g != 1:\\n        return None\\n    else:\\n        return x % m\\n\\ndef solve_congruence(mod_rem_list):\\n    # mod_rem_list is list of tuples (mod, remainder)\\n    if not mod_rem_list:\\n        return 0\\n    current_mod, current_rem = mod_rem_list[0]\\n    for mod, rem in mod_rem_list[1:]:\\n        # find x ≡ current_rem mod current_mod\\n        # and x ≡ rem mod mod → solve for x\\n        a = current_mod\\n        target_remainder = rem - current_rem\\n        b = mod\\n        # equation: a*k ≡ target_remainder mod b → a*k ≡ (rem - current_rem) mod mod\\n        # find k such that current_rem + a*k ≡ rem mod mod → a*k ≡ (rem - current_rem) mod mod →\\n        # but a is current_mod, and equation is a*k ≡ (rem - current_rem) mod mod\\n        \\n        # So we have equation:\\n        # (current_mod)*k ≡ (rem - current_rem) mod mod\\n        \\n        # To solve for k\\n        numerator = rem - current_rem\\n        a_val = current_mod\\n        b_val = mod\\n        # We need to solve a_val *k ≡ numerator mod b_val\\n        g = math.gcd(a_val, b_val)\\n        if numerator % g !=0:\\n            return None\\n        \\n        a_div_g = a_val // g\\n        b_div_g = b_val //g\\n        numerator_div_g = numerator //g\\n        \\n        # Now equation reduces to a_div_g *k ≡ numerator_div_g mod b_div_g\\n        # since a_div_g and b_div_g are coprime\\n        \\n        inv = modular_inverse(a_div_g, b_div_g)\\n        if inv is None:\\n            return None # shouldn\\'t happen because they are coprime, but in case...\\n        k_base = (numerator_div_g * inv) % b_div_g\\n        \\n        # minimal solution for k is k_base\\n        # so the solution to the equation is:\\n        # k = k_base + t*b_div_g\\n        # therefore x = current_rem + k_base*current_mod\\n        \\n        new_x = current_rem + k_base * a_val\\n        # now the new modulus is LCM(current_mod, mod) = (current_mod * mod) // g\\n        \\n        new_mod = current_mod * mod // g\\n        new_rem = new_x % new_mod\\n        \\n        current_mod = new_mod\\n        current_rem = new_rem\\n        \\n    return current_rem\\n\\nWait I had to adjust the way the equations are combined here.\\n\\nWait the approach I took in the code is similar but may have some adjustments.\\n\\nWait in the previous code, when combining equation pairs, the code uses steps similar to:\\n\\nCombine first pairwise congruence solutions.\\n\\nThus, perhaps this code may need testing.\\n\\nAlternatively, to correct the above code, perhaps need to code step-by-step integration.\\n\\nAlternatively, better to use a correct implementation of CRT.\\n\\nBut given time constraints, let me test.\\n\\nLet me try an example.\\n\\nTake the original problem\\'s parameters:\\n\\nk=9 (odd), m=10 (even), n=11 (odd)\\n\\nCongruence conditions:\\n\\nFor k (9, odd): remainder 0 mod9.\\n\\nFor m (10, even): remainder 5 mod10 (because 10/2=5).\\n\\nFor n (11, odd): 0 mod11.\\n\\nThe congruences:\\n\\nN ≡0 mod9,\\n\\nN ≡5 mod10,\\n\\nN≡0 mod11.\\n\\nThe minimal solution was 495.\\n\\nNow, passing the congruence list [(9,0), (10,5), (11,0)] to solve_congruence.\\n\\nLet\\'s see step1:\\n\\nFirst congruence (9,0), then combine with (10,5):\\n\\nThe first step:\\n\\ncurrent_mod=9, current_rem=0.\\n\\nNow, adding (10,5):\\n\\nEquation:\\n\\nx ≡0 mod9\\n\\nand x ≡5 mod10.\\n\\nSet x = 9a.\\n\\nThus: 9a ≡5 mod10 → 9a mod10=5. \\n\\n9 mod10 is 9.\\n\\n9a mod10=5 → possible?\\n\\nLooking for a such that 9a ≡5 mod10.\\n\\nTry a=9 →9*9=81 mod10 →1.\\n\\na=5 →45 mod10 →5. Bingo. So a=5 mod10.\\n\\nThen, minimal solution is a=5 → x=9*5=45.\\n\\nWait but let\\'s see what happens in the solve_congruence code.\\n\\nProcessing second entry (10,5):\\n\\ntarget_remainder =5 - current_rem (0)=5.\\n\\nThe a_val = current_mod (9), mod becomes b_val=10.\\n\\nEquation: 9*k ≡5 mod10.\\n\\ng = gcd(9,10)=1.\\n\\nSince 5 mod1 is 0 → okay.\\n\\na_div_g is 9, b_div_g is 10.\\n\\ninv of 9 mod10: (since 9^{-1} mod10 is 9, because 9*9=81≡1 mod10).\\n\\ninv=9.\\n\\nSo numerator_div_g is 5.\\n\\nk_base = (5 *9) mod10 →45 mod10 →5.\\n\\nThus, solution k_base=5.\\n\\nnew_x = current_rem (0) + 5 * current_mod(9) →5*9=45. \\n\\nnew_mod = (9 *10)/1 =90.\\n\\nnew_rem is 45 mod90 →45.\\n\\nProceed to third congruence, (11,0):\\n\\ncurrent_mod is 90, current_rem is45.\\n\\nNow congruence to add: mod=11, remainder0.\\n\\nCompute equation:\\n\\nx ≡45 mod90,\\n\\nand x ≡0 mod11.\\n\\nSet x =45 +90k.\\n\\nWe want 45 +90k ≡0 mod11 → (45 mod11 is 1, since11*4=44 → 45 mod11=1).\\n\\n45 mod11=1 → so equation:\\n\\n1 +90k ≡0 mod11 → 90 mod11 is 90-8*11=90-88=2. So 2k ≡-1 mod11 →2k≡10 mod11 (since -1 mod11=10).\\n\\nThus solving 2k ≡10 mod11 → k≡5 mod11 (since inverse of 2 mod11 is 6 (2*6=12≡1 mod11), so multiply both sides by6: k≡10*6 mod11 →60 mod11 →60 - 5*11=60-55=5 mod11.\\n\\nThus k=5+t*11.\\n\\nThe minimal solution is k=5 → x =45 +90*5=45+450=495.\\n\\nWhich is correct.\\n\\nSo the code would return 495, which matches expected.\\n\\nHence it works here.\\n\\nTesting another case.\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\nLet me choose k=4, m=6, n=5.\\n\\nWait, check first congruences:\\n\\nk=4 (even):\\n\\nremainder 2 mod4.\\n\\nm=6 (even):\\n\\nremainder3 mod6.\\n\\nn=5 (odd):\\n\\n0 mod5.\\n\\nCheck if this system can be solved:\\n\\nN ≡2 mod4,\\n\\nN≡3 mod6,\\n\\nN≡0 mod5.\\n\\nCheck congruences pairwise:\\n\\nFirst congruence mod4 and mod6:\\n\\nCheck compatibility.\\n\\nCheck N mod mod2 and mod mod1.\\n\\nWait mod4 and mod6:\\n\\nGCD(4,6)=2.\\n\\nCheck whether (remainder mod4 - remainder mod6) mod GCD divides?\\n\\nWait the congruences N≡2 mod4 and N≡3 mod6.\\n\\nCheck if 2 ≡3 mod2 (gcd4 and6 is2).\\n\\nYes, because 2 mod2 is0, and 3 mod2 is1. 0≠1 mod2 → this is incompatible. Therefore, system has no solution.\\n\\nThus, this trio would be discarded by the code because solve_congruence would return None, and the loop would retry.\\n\\nThus the code would not produce such a problem, because it requires the congruence equations to have a solution.\\n\\nTherefore the code is working as intended.\\n\\nTherefore, the code should be okay.\\n\\nThus, putting all together.\\n\\nNow, code:\\n\\nFirst, imports.\\n\\nimport math\\n\\nimport random\\n\\nWait but also need include the helper functions.\\n\\nSo putting everything into the code.\\n\\nThe functions need to be defined first.\\n\\nLet me now proceed to code the full code:\\n\\nThe code includes:\\n\\n- helper functions: extended_gcd, modular_inverse, solve_congruence.\\n\\n- generate_problem function with a loop to select k,m,n randomly,\\n\\n- and testing with some brute-force checks.\\n\\nAlso, need to add brute-force unit tests, for code verification.\\n\\nThus, perhaps in main(), run generate_problem multiple times, check solutions satisfy the three conditions.\\n\\nWait, but in code, to add testing, perhaps in the code after generating a problem, the solution should be checked.\\n\\nThus, here is possible code with the problem generation and testing.\\n\\nFull code:\\n\\nimport math\\nimport random\\n\\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\\n    if a == 0:\\n        return (b, 0, 1)\\n    else:\\n        g, y, x = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\\n        return (g, x -
