The problem is about finding the number of quadruples (P, Q, R, k) where P, Q, R are positive digits (so 1 through 9) and k is a positive integer with k \\u2264 2018. The condition given is that P in 2k digits minus Q in k digits equals R in k digits squared. Then we need to find N, the number of such quadruples, and then compute the sum of the digits of N.\\n\\nFirst, let's understand what the notation means. For a digit D and integer k, D_{(k)} is a number with k digits all equal to D. For example, 3_{(4)} is 3333. So, P_{(2k)} is a number with 2k digits all P, Q_{(k)} is a number with k digits all Q, and R_{(k)} is a number with k digits all R. The equation given is:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nOur goal is to find all quadruples (P, Q, R, k) that satisfy this equation, with the constraints on P, Q, R being digits (1-9) and k \\u2264 2018.\\n\\nFirst, let's express these numbers numerically. Let's write expressions for each term.\\n\\nFor a digit D and number of digits m, D_{(m)} can be written as D \\u00d7 (10^{m} - 1)/9. For example, 3_{(4)} = 3 \\u00d7 (10\\u2074 - 1)/9 = 3 \\u00d7 1111 = 3333. So:\\n\\n- P_{(2k)} = P \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1)/9\\n- Q_{(k)} = Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9\\n- R_{(k)} = R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9\\n\\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\\n\\nP \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1)/9 - Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9 = [R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9]\\u00b2\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators:\\n\\nP \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1) - Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1) = [R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)]\\u00b2 / 9\\n\\nWait, actually, if we multiply both sides by 9, the left side becomes:\\n\\n9 \\u00d7 [P \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1)/9 - Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9] = P \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1) - Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)\\n\\nAnd the right side becomes:\\n\\n9 \\u00d7 [R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9]\\u00b2 = [R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)]\\u00b2 / 9\\n\\nWait, actually, squaring [R*(10^k -1)/9] would give [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/81, then multiplying by 9 gives [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9. So:\\n\\nLeft side: P*(10^{2k} -1) - Q*(10^k -1)\\nRight side: [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9\\n\\nSo the equation is:\\n\\nP*(10^{2k} -1) - Q*(10^k -1) = [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9\\n\\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor or rearrange terms. Let's see.\\n\\nFirst, note that 10^{2k} -1 factors as (10^k -1)(10^k +1). So:\\n\\nLeft side: P*(10^k -1)(10^k +1) - Q*(10^k -1) = (10^k -1)[P*(10^k +1) - Q]\\n\\nSo, left side is (10^k -1)[P*(10^k +1) - Q]\\n\\nRight side is [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9\\n\\nSo, setting them equal:\\n\\n(10^k -1)[P*(10^k +1) - Q] = [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9\\n\\nWe can divide both sides by (10^k -1), assuming 10^k -1 \\u2260 0, which it isn't since k is a positive integer. So:\\n\\nP*(10^k +1) - Q = [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)]/9\\n\\nNow, let's rearrange this equation:\\n\\n9[P*(10^k +1) - Q] = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9P*(10^k +1) - 9Q = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)\\n\\nLet me write this as:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P + R\\u00b2) - 9Q = 0\\n\\nWait, let's expand the left side:\\n\\n9P*(10^k +1) = 9P*10^k + 9P\\n\\nThen subtract 9Q: 9P*10^k + 9P - 9Q\\n\\nSet equal to R\\u00b2*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*10^k - R\\u00b2\\n\\nTherefore, moving everything to left side:\\n\\n9P*10^k + 9P - 9Q - R\\u00b2*10^k + R\\u00b2 = 0\\n\\nFactor terms with 10^k:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P - 9Q + R\\u00b2) = 0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P - 9Q + R\\u00b2) = 0\\n\\nLet me denote:\\n\\nA = 9P - R\\u00b2\\n\\nB = 9P - 9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nSo the equation becomes:\\n\\nA*10^k + B = 0\\n\\nWhich gives:\\n\\nA*10^k = -B\\n\\nBut 10^k is positive, so for this equation to hold, A and B must have opposite signs, but since 10^k is a large positive number (k is positive integer), unless A and B are both zero? Wait, but if A and B are both zero, then equation holds for all k. Wait, but in our case, since A and B depend on P, Q, R, which are digits, maybe there are solutions where A and B are zero? Let's check.\\n\\nIf A = 0 and B = 0, then:\\n\\n9P - R\\u00b2 = 0\\n\\nand\\n\\n9P - 9Q + R\\u00b2 = 0\\n\\nFrom the first equation: R\\u00b2 = 9P. Since R is a digit (1-9), R\\u00b2 can be 1,4,9,16,...,81. But R is a digit, so R\\u00b2 must be a perfect square from 1 to 81. Since 9P must equal R\\u00b2, and P is a digit (1-9), so 9P ranges from 9 to 81. So R\\u00b2 must be a multiple of 9 between 9 and 81, hence R\\u00b2 can be 9, 36, 81. So:\\n\\nIf R\\u00b2 = 9, then 9P = 9 \\u21d2 P =1\\n\\nIf R\\u00b2 = 36, then 9P = 36 \\u21d2 P =4\\n\\nIf R\\u00b2 = 81, then 9P =81 \\u21d2 P=9\\n\\nSo possible (P, R) pairs are (1,3), (4,6), (9,9). Then, from the second equation:\\n\\n9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 = 0 \\u21d2 9P -9Q +9P =0 (since R\\u00b2=9P from first equation)\\n\\nWait, wait, the second equation is 9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 = 0. But since R\\u00b2 =9P, substituting:\\n\\n9P -9Q +9P =0 \\u21d2 18P -9Q =0 \\u21d2 2P = Q\\n\\nSo Q = 2P.\\n\\nBut P is a digit (1-9), and Q must be a digit (1-9). So let's check for each possible (P, R):\\n\\nCase 1: P=1, R=3. Then Q=2*1=2. Q=2 is valid.\\n\\nCase 2: P=4, R=6. Then Q=2*4=8. Q=8 is valid.\\n\\nCase 3: P=9, R=9. Then Q=2*9=18. But Q must be a digit (1-9). 18 is invalid. So this case is invalid.\\n\\nTherefore, when A=0 and B=0, we have two possible quadruples: (P, Q, R, k) = (1,2,3,k) and (4,8,6,k), for any k. Since k is a positive integer with k \\u22642018, each of these quadruples would contribute 2018 possibilities (since k can be any from 1 to 2018). However, the problem states \\\"quadruples (P, Q, R, k)\\\" with P, Q, R positive digits and k \\u22642018. So each of these (P, Q, R) pairs (1,2,3) and (4,8,6) would be paired with all k from 1 to 2018, hence 2018 quadruples each. So that's 2*2018 =4036 quadruples.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem says \\\"quadruples (P, Q, R, k)\\\", so if these two (P, Q, R) combinations work for any k, then indeed each k gives a distinct quadruple. So if A=0 and B=0, then the equation holds for any k. Therefore, these two (P, Q, R) combinations are valid for all k from 1 to 2018, hence 2018 each. So 2*2018=4036 quadruples from this case.\\n\\nNow, besides the case where A=0 and B=0, are there other solutions where A and B are non-zero but satisfy A*10^k + B=0? Let's see.\\n\\nFrom the equation A*10^k + B =0, we have:\\n\\nA*10^k = -B\\n\\nSince A and B are integers (as P, Q, R are digits and coefficients are integers), and 10^k is positive. Therefore, A must be negative and B must be positive, or vice versa. But let's see:\\n\\nA =9P - R\\u00b2\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nIf A is negative, then 9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 >9P\\n\\nIf B is positive, then 9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 >9Q -9P\\n\\nAlternatively, if A is positive and B is negative, but then 10^k is positive, so A*10^k + B=0 would require B = -A*10^k, which is negative. But if A is positive, then B must be negative.\\n\\nBut given that P, Q, R are digits (1-9), let's see possible values for A and B.\\n\\nCompute possible A and B.\\n\\nA =9P - R\\u00b2. Since P is 1-9, 9P ranges 9-81. R is 1-9, R\\u00b2 ranges 1-81. So A can be from 9*1 -81= -72 to 9*9 -1=80.\\n\\nSimilarly, B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2. Since 9P -9Q can be from 9*1 -9*9= -72 to 9*9 -9*1=72. Then adding R\\u00b2 (1-81), so B can be from -72 +1= -71 to 72 +81=153.\\n\\nBut given that A and B must satisfy A*10^k + B =0, so A*10^k = -B. Therefore, A and B must have opposite signs. Let's consider two cases:\\n\\nCase 1: A positive, B negative. Then A*10^k = -B. Since A is positive, B is negative. Then:\\n\\nA*10^k = |B|\\n\\nSo |B| must be divisible by A, and |B| = A*10^k. But since B is 9P -9Q + R\\u00b2, which is an integer between -71 and 153, and A is 9P - R\\u00b2, which is between -72 and 80. But given A is positive here, so 9P - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 <9P.\\n\\nSimilarly, since |B| = A*10^k, and |B| is at most 153 (since B is between -71 and 153, but here B is negative, so |B| is up to 71). But A is positive integer (since A =9P - R\\u00b2 >0). So A*10^k = |B|.\\n\\nBut 10^k is at least 10 (since k is at least 1). But |B| is at most 71 in this case. So A*10^k \\u226471. But A is at least 1 (since 9P - R\\u00b2 is positive integer). So 1*10^k \\u226471 \\u21d2 10^k \\u226471. Since k is a positive integer, k can be 1 or 2 (10^1=10, 10^2=100). 10^2=100 which is already greater than 71. So k can only be 1 here. Then:\\n\\nA*10^1 \\u226471 \\u21d2 10A \\u226471 \\u21d2 A \\u22647.1, so A \\u22647. Since A is positive integer, A=1,2,...,7.\\n\\nThus, possible A=1 to7. For each A, |B| =10*A. But |B| is at most 71, so 10*A \\u226471 \\u21d2 A \\u22647.1, which is satisfied. So:\\n\\nFor A=1, |B|=10 \\u21d2 B=-10\\n\\nFor A=2, |B|=20 \\u21d2 B=-20\\n\\n...\\n\\nFor A=7, |B|=70 \\u21d2 B=-70\\n\\nBut B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2. So for each A from 1 to7, we have:\\n\\nFrom A=9P - R\\u00b2 and B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2= -10, -20,..., -70\\n\\nBut since A=9P - R\\u00b2 and B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2, let's substitute R\\u00b2 =9P - A into B:\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + (9P -A)= 18P -9Q -A\\n\\nSet this equal to -10A (since |B|=10A and B is negative, so B= -10A):\\n\\nWait, actually, from above, |B| = A*10^k. But in this case, k=1, so |B|=10A. So B= -10A. Therefore:\\n\\n18P -9Q -A = -10A\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n18P -9Q = -9A\\n\\nDivide both sides by 9:\\n\\n2P - Q = -A\\n\\nBut A=9P - R\\u00b2. Therefore:\\n\\n2P - Q = - (9P - R\\u00b2)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n2P - Q = -9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nBring all terms to left side:\\n\\n11P - Q - R\\u00b2 =0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n11P - Q = R\\u00b2\\n\\nGiven that P, Q, R are digits (1-9), let's analyze this equation: 11P - Q = R\\u00b2.\\n\\nSince Q is a digit from 1-9, 11P - Q ranges from 11*1 -9=2 to 11*9 -1=98. But R\\u00b2 is a square from 1 to81. Therefore, possible R\\u00b2 can be 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81.\\n\\nSo 11P - Q must be one of these squares. Let's consider possible R\\u00b2 values and solve for P and Q.\\n\\nFor each R from 1 to9, R\\u00b2 is as above. Then 11P - Q = R\\u00b2.\\n\\nBut since Q is between 1 and9, 11P must be between R\\u00b2 +1 and R\\u00b2 +9. Therefore:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 +1 \\u226411P \\u2264 R\\u00b2 +9\\n\\nThus, 11P must be in the interval [R\\u00b2 +1, R\\u00b2 +9]. So:\\n\\n(R\\u00b2 +1)/11 \\u2264 P \\u2264 (R\\u00b2 +9)/11\\n\\nBut P must be an integer between1 and9. Let's compute for each R:\\n\\nCase 1: R=1, R\\u00b2=1\\n\\nThen 11P \\u2208 [2,10]\\n\\nSo P must be 1, since 11*1=11 is not in [2,10]. Wait, 11P must be between 2 and10, but 11P is at least11. So no solution here.\\n\\nWait, this is a contradiction. So for R=1, R\\u00b2=1, 11P - Q=1. Then Q=11P -1. Since Q must be between1-9, 11P -1 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226410 \\u21d2P \\u22640.9, which is impossible. So R=1: no solution.\\n\\nSimilarly, R=2, R\\u00b2=4\\n\\n11P - Q=4 \\u21d2 Q=11P -4\\n\\nQ must be 1-9, so 11P -4 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226413 \\u21d2P \\u22641.18 \\u21d2 P=1\\n\\nThen Q=11*1 -4=7. So (P,Q,R)=(1,7,2). Check if 11P - Q=11 -7=4=2\\u00b2. Yes. So this is a valid solution.\\n\\nCheck if this satisfies A=9P - R\\u00b2=9*1 -4=5, and B= -10A= -50.\\n\\nBut let's check if this works in the original equation. Let's see.\\n\\nGiven (P, Q, R, k)=(1,7,2,1). Let's check if P_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)}= (R_{(k)})\\u00b2.\\n\\nHere k=1. So:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=11, Q_{(1)}=7, R_{(1)}=2. Then:\\n\\n11 -7=4, and 2\\u00b2=4. So yes, it works. So this is a valid solution. So (1,7,2,1) is a quadruple. Since k=1 here.\\n\\nBut earlier, in this case, we're considering k=1 because for A positive and B negative, the only possible k is1. So this quadruple is part of this case.\\n\\nContinuing with R=2, found one solution: (1,7,2).\\n\\nR=3, R\\u00b2=9\\n\\n11P - Q=9 \\u21d2 Q=11P -9\\n\\nQ must be 1-9, so 11P -9 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226418 \\u21d2P \\u22641.63 \\u21d2 P=1.\\n\\nThen Q=11*1 -9=2. So (P,Q,R)=(1,2,3). Check 11*1 -2=9=3\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSo this is another solution: (1,2,3). Now check with the equations.\\n\\nA=9P - R\\u00b2=9*1 -9=0. Wait, A=0? But in this case, we were considering A positive and B negative, but here A=0. However, earlier, when A=0, we have the case where A=0 and B=0, which we considered before, leading to quadruples (1,2,3,k) for all k. But here, in the current case where A positive and B negative, we found a solution (1,2,3) which actually belongs to the previous case where A=0. Therefore, perhaps this is overlapping with the previous case.\\n\\nWait, if R=3, then R\\u00b2=9. Then A=9P - R\\u00b2=9*1 -9=0. So A=0. Then B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=9*1 -9*2 +9=9 -18 +9=0. Therefore, this is part of the case where A=0 and B=0, which is valid for all k. So perhaps when we considered R=3, even though in this step we found (1,2,3), this is already counted in the previous case where A=0 and B=0. So in the current case (A positive, B negative), perhaps we should not have considered R=3, because it leads to A=0, which is a different case. Therefore, maybe the solution (1,2,3) is already accounted for in the A=0 and B=0 case, and we need to avoid double-counting.\\n\\nBut in our previous analysis for R=3, we found that (1,2,3) is part of the A=0 and B=0 case, which works for all k. So in this current case (A positive, B negative), when we set R=3, we end up with A=0, which is invalid here. So perhaps the solution (1,2,3) is not part of this case. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in including it here. Let's verify.\\n\\nWait, when we started this case (A positive, B negative), we considered A=9P - R\\u00b2 >0. However, for R=3, we have A=0. Therefore, R=3 is excluded from this case. So perhaps when solving R=3, we get A=0, which is not part of this case. Therefore, maybe there was an error in the analysis.\\n\\nWait, let's step back. When we considered the case where A positive and B negative, we had equations leading to 11P - Q = R\\u00b2. For R=3, R\\u00b2=9, so 11P - Q=9. Solving for Q=11P -9. For P=1, Q=2. Then A=9*1 -9=0, which is not positive, so this solution is invalid in this case (A positive). Therefore, even though algebraically solving 11P - Q = R\\u00b2 gives a solution, when we check A, we find it's zero, so this solution is invalid in this case and belongs to the previous A=0 case.\\n\\nTherefore, in the current case (A positive, B negative), R=3 is invalid because it leads to A=0. So for R=3, no solution in this case. Therefore, the solution (1,2,3) is part of the A=0 case.\\n\\nContinuing:\\n\\nR=4, R\\u00b2=16\\n\\n11P - Q=16 \\u21d2 Q=11P -16\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -16 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226517 \\u21d2P\\u22651.54\\u21d2 P=2 or higher\\n\\nAlso, 11P -16 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226425 \\u21d2P\\u22642.27\\u21d2 P=2\\n\\nSo P=2. Q=11*2 -16=22 -16=6. So (P,Q,R)=(2,6,4). Check 11*2 -6=22 -6=16=4\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSo this is a valid solution: (2,6,4). Now check A and B.\\n\\nA=9P - R\\u00b2=9*2 -16=18 -16=2\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=18 -54 +16= -20\\n\\nSo A=2, B=-20. Then equation A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d22*10^k -20=0 \\u21d22*10^k=20 \\u21d210^k=10 \\u21d2k=1. So k=1 is valid.\\n\\nTherefore, quadruple (2,6,4,1) is a solution.\\n\\nCheck in original equation:\\n\\nP_{(2k)}=2_{(2)}=22\\n\\nQ_{(k)}=6_{(1)}=6\\n\\nR_{(k)}=4_{(1)}=4\\n\\n22 -6=16=4\\u00b2. Correct. So this works.\\n\\nContinuing:\\n\\nR=5, R\\u00b2=25\\n\\n11P - Q=25 \\u21d2Q=11P -25\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -25 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226526 \\u21d2P\\u22652.36\\u21d2 P=3,4,...,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -25 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226434 \\u21d2P\\u22643.09\\u21d2 P=3\\n\\nSo P=3. Q=11*3 -25=33 -25=8. So (3,8,5). Check 11*3 -8=33 -8=25=5\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*3 -25=27 -25=2\\n\\nB=9*3 -9*8 +25=27 -72 +25= -20\\n\\nSo A=2, B=-20. Then equation A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d22*10^k=20 \\u21d2k=1.\\n\\nTherefore, quadruple (3,8,5,1). Check original equation:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=33, Q_{(1)}=8, R_{(1)}=5. 33 -8=25=5\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nR=6, R\\u00b2=36\\n\\n11P - Q=36 \\u21d2Q=11P -36\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -36 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226537 \\u21d2P\\u22653.36\\u21d2 P=4,5,...,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -36 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226445 \\u21d2P\\u22644.09\\u21d2 P=4\\n\\nSo P=4. Q=11*4 -36=44 -36=8. So (4,8,6). Check 11*4 -8=44 -8=36=6\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*4 -36=36 -36=0. Again, A=0. So this is part of the A=0 case. So this solution (4,8,6) is part of the A=0 and B=0 case, which works for all k. Therefore, in the current case (A positive, B negative), this is invalid, as A=0.\\n\\nR=7, R\\u00b2=49\\n\\n11P - Q=49 \\u21d2Q=11P -49\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -49 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226550 \\u21d2P\\u22654.54\\u21d2 P=5,6,...,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -49 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226458 \\u21d2P\\u22645.27\\u21d2 P=5\\n\\nSo P=5. Q=11*5 -49=55 -49=6. So (5,6,7). Check 11*5 -6=55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*5 -49=45 -49=-4\\n\\nBut we are in the case where A is positive. So here A=-4, which is invalid. Therefore, this solution is invalid in this case. So even though algebraically we found (5,6,7), when computing A, it's negative, so this is part of a different case.\\n\\nBut wait, in this case, we set up the equation with A positive and B negative. So if A is negative here, this is not part of this case. Therefore, this solution (5,6,7) must be part of the other case where A negative and B positive. Let's see.\\n\\nR=7, R\\u00b2=49:\\n\\nA=9P - R\\u00b2=45 -49=-4\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=45 -54 +49=40\\n\\nSo equation: A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d2 -4*10^k +40=0 \\u21d2 -4*10^k = -40 \\u21d210^k=10\\u21d2k=1. So k=1.\\n\\nSo here, A is negative, B is positive. So this belongs to the other case. So we'll get to this later.\\n\\nContinuing with R=7, since in our current case (A positive, B negative), this solution is invalid. So R=7 doesn't give a solution here.\\n\\nR=8, R\\u00b2=64\\n\\n11P - Q=64 \\u21d2Q=11P -64\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -64 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226565 \\u21d2P\\u22655.9\\u21d2 P=6,7,8,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -64 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226473 \\u21d2P\\u22646.63\\u21d2 P=6\\n\\nSo P=6. Q=11*6 -64=66 -64=2. So (6,2,8). Check 11*6 -2=66 -2=64=8\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*6 -64=54 -64=-10\\n\\nB=9*6 -9*2 +64=54 -18 +64=100\\n\\nEquation: A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d2-10*10^k +100=0 \\u21d2-10^{k+1} +100=0 \\u21d210^{k+1}=100\\u21d2k+1=2\\u21d2k=1.\\n\\nSo k=1. So quadruple (6,2,8,1). Check:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=66, Q_{(1)}=2, R_{(1)}=8. 66 -2=64=8\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nBut here, A=-10 which is negative, B=100 positive. So this belongs to the other case (A negative, B positive). Therefore, not part of the current case.\\n\\nR=9, R\\u00b2=81\\n\\n11P - Q=81 \\u21d2Q=11P -81\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -81 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226582 \\u21d2P\\u22657.45\\u21d2 P=8,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -81 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226490 \\u21d2P\\u22648.18\\u21d2 P=8\\n\\nSo P=8. Q=11*8 -81=88 -81=7. So (8,7,9). Check 11*8 -7=88 -7=81=9\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*8 -81=72 -81=-9\\n\\nB=9*8 -9*7 +81=72 -63 +81=90\\n\\nEquation: A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d2-9*10^k +90=0 \\u21d2-9*10^k = -90 \\u21d210^k=10 \\u21d2k=1.\\n\\nThus, quadruple (8,7,9,1). Check:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=88, Q_{(1)}=7, R_{(1)}=9. 88 -7=81=9\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nBut again, A is negative here, so this is part of the other case.\\n\\nSo summarizing Case 1 (A positive, B negative), we found the following solutions:\\n\\n- R=2: (P,Q,R)=(1,7,2) with k=1\\n\\n- R=4: (2,6,4) with k=1\\n\\n- R=5: (3,8,5) with k=1\\n\\nBut wait, when R=5, we had (3,8,5) with A=2 and B=-20, so A=2 positive, B=-20 negative. So that is part of this case. Similarly, R=2 and R=4 give valid solutions here. However, R=3 and R=6 lead to A=0, which are part of the earlier case. So in total, in Case 1 (A positive, B negative), we have three solutions: (1,7,2,1), (2,6,4,1), (3,8,5,1). Each with k=1.\\n\\nNow let's consider Case 2: A negative and B positive.\\n\\nSo A=9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 >9P\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 >0\\n\\nFrom the equation A*10^k + B =0 \\u21d2 A*10^k = -B. Since A is negative and B is positive, this equation is possible. Let's write:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k = - (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2)\\n\\nLet me rearrange this:\\n\\n( R\\u00b2 -9P )*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nLet me denote C = R\\u00b2 -9P (which is positive since A=9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d2 C= -A >0)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nC*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nBut R\\u00b2 = C +9P. Substitute into the equation:\\n\\nC*10^k =9P -9Q + C +9P\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nC*10^k =18P -9Q + C\\n\\nSubtract C from both sides:\\n\\nC*(10^k -1) =18P -9Q\\n\\nDivide both sides by9:\\n\\nC*(10^k -1)/9 =2P - Q\\n\\nLet me denote D = C*(10^k -1)/9. Then:\\n\\n2P - Q = D\\n\\nBut Q is a digit from1-9, so 2P - D = Q. Since Q \\u22651, 2P - D \\u22651. Also, Q \\u22649 \\u21d22P - D \\u22649 \\u21d2 D \\u22652P -9\\n\\nBut D is equal to C*(10^k -1)/9, where C=R\\u00b2 -9P (positive integer). Let's analyze.\\n\\nGiven that C = R\\u00b2 -9P >0, so R\\u00b2 >9P.\\n\\nAlso, D = [C*(10^k -1)]/9.\\n\\nSince 10^k -1 is divisible by9 (since 10^k \\u22611 mod9, so 10^k -1 \\u22610 mod9), so (10^k -1)/9 is an integer. For example, (10^1 -1)/9=1, (10^2 -1)/9=11, etc. Let me denote S_k = (10^k -1)/9, which is an integer with k digits all 1's. For example, S_1=1, S_2=11, S_3=111, etc.\\n\\nTherefore, D= C * S_k\\n\\nSo 2P - Q = C * S_k\\n\\nBut Q=2P - C * S_k\\n\\nSince Q must be a digit (1-9), we have:\\n\\n1 \\u22642P - C * S_k \\u22649\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n2P -9 \\u2264C * S_k \\u22642P -1\\n\\nBut C = R\\u00b2 -9P >0, so substituting:\\n\\n2P -9 \\u2264(R\\u00b2 -9P)*S_k \\u22642P -1\\n\\nThis seems complicated. Let's see if we can find possible values for k.\\n\\nGiven that S_k is 1,11,111,..., up to k=2018. However, since C is at least1 (since R\\u00b2 -9P \\u22651, because R\\u00b2 >9P and R and P are integers), and S_k grows exponentially with k. However, the left side 2P -9 is at least 2*1 -9= -7 and at most 2*9 -9=9. The right side 2P -1 is at least1 (for P=1:2*1 -1=1) and at most17 (for P=9:2*9 -1=17). But C * S_k is a positive integer (since C>0 and S_k>0). Therefore:\\n\\nLeft inequality: 2P -9 \\u2264C * S_k\\n\\nBut since C * S_k \\u22651*1=1, and 2P -9 can be negative. So the real constraints come from:\\n\\nC * S_k \\u22642P -1\\n\\nBut since C = R\\u00b2 -9P and R is at most9, R\\u00b2 is at most81. So C = R\\u00b2 -9P \\u226481 -9*1=72. So C \\u226472. But S_k = (10^k -1)/9. For k=1, S_1=1; k=2, S_2=11; k=3,111, etc.\\n\\nBut the right inequality C * S_k \\u22642P -1. Let's consider possible values of k.\\n\\nIf k=1, S_1=1. So:\\n\\nC*1 \\u22642P -1 \\u21d2C \\u22642P -1. But C=R\\u00b2 -9P, so:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 -9P \\u22642P -1 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226411P -1\\n\\nGiven that R\\u00b2 >9P (from C>0), so 9P < R\\u00b2 \\u226411P -1\\n\\nSo R must satisfy:\\n\\nFor each P, possible R such that 9P < R\\u00b2 \\u226411P -1\\n\\nSince R is a digit (1-9), R\\u00b2 can be up to81. Let's check for each P from1 to9:\\n\\nP=1:\\n\\n9*1=9 < R\\u00b2 \\u226411*1 -1=10. So R\\u00b2 must be between9 and10. The only integer R\\u00b2 in this range is9, but R\\u00b2>9. So no solution.\\n\\nP=2:\\n\\n9*2=18 < R\\u00b2 \\u226422 -1=21. So R\\u00b2 must be 19,20,21. But R\\u00b2 must be a square. No squares in 19-21.\\n\\nP=3:\\n\\n27 < R\\u00b2 \\u226433 -1=32. R\\u00b2=25, but 25<27. Next square is36>32. No solution.\\n\\nP=4:\\n\\n36 < R\\u00b2 \\u226444 -1=43. R\\u00b2=36 is not greater than36. Next square is49>43. No solution.\\n\\nP=5:\\n\\n45 < R\\u00b2 \\u226455 -1=54. R\\u00b2=49<45? No, 49>45. Wait, 45 < R\\u00b2 \\u226454. So R\\u00b2=49, but 49 is in the range (45,54]. So R=7. Check if R\\u00b2=49.\\n\\nSo P=5, R=7. Then C=R\\u00b2 -9P=49 -45=4\\n\\nThen Q=2P - C*S_k=10 -4*1=6. So (5,6,7). Check if 11P - Q=55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nWait, but this solution (5,6,7) we found earlier in the A negative case. So for k=1, we can have this solution.\\n\\nBut let's verify the original equation. For (5,6,7,1):\\n\\nP_{(2)}=55, Q_{(1)}=6, R_{(1)}=7. 55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, check if there are other solutions for k=1.\\n\\nP=6:\\n\\n54 < R\\u00b2 \\u226466 -1=65. R\\u00b2=64 (since 64 is in (54,65]). R=8. C=64 -54=10. Q=12 -10*1=2. So (6,2,8). Check 11*6 -2=66 -2=64=8\\u00b2. Correct. So (6,2,8,1) is another solution.\\n\\nP=7:\\n\\n63 < R\\u00b2 \\u226477 -1=76. R\\u00b2=64,81. 64<63? No. 81>76. No solution.\\n\\nP=8:\\n\\n72 < R\\u00b2 \\u226488 -1=87. R\\u00b2=81. R=9. C=81 -72=9. Q=16 -9*1=7. So (8,7,9). Check 11*8 -7=88 -7=81=9\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nP=9:\\n\\n81 < R\\u00b2 \\u226499 -1=98. R\\u00b2=81 is not greater than81. Next square is100>98. No solution.\\n\\nTherefore, for k=1, we have solutions:\\n\\n(5,6,7,1), (6,2,8,1), (8,7,9,1)\\n\\nThese are the same solutions we found earlier when considering R=5,7,8,9 in the previous case. So for k=1, in Case2 (A negative, B positive), we have three solutions.\\n\\nNow, check for k=2.\\n\\nFor k=2, S_2=11.\\n\\nSo equation:\\n\\nC *11 =2P - Q\\n\\nBut C=R\\u00b2 -9P>0.\\n\\nSo Q=2P -11C\\n\\nSince Q must be a digit (1-9):\\n\\n1 \\u22642P -11C \\u22649\\n\\nBut C\\u22651, so:\\n\\n2P -11*1 \\u22651 \\u21d22P \\u226512 \\u21d2P\\u22656\\n\\nAlso,\\n\\n2P -11C \\u22649 \\u21d211C \\u22652P -9\\n\\nBut since C=R\\u00b2 -9P, and C\\u22651, so R\\u00b2 -9P \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u22659P +1.\\n\\nBut P\\u22656, so R\\u00b2 \\u22659*6 +1=55. R is a digit up to9, so R\\u00b2=64,81.\\n\\nLet's check for P=6:\\n\\nC=R\\u00b2 -54 \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226555. Possible R\\u00b2=64,81. So R=8,9.\\n\\nFor R=8:\\n\\nC=64 -54=10\\n\\nQ=2*6 -11*10=12 -110= -98. Invalid, since Q must be positive.\\n\\nFor R=9:\\n\\nC=81 -54=27\\n\\nQ=12 -11*27=12 -297= -285. Invalid.\\n\\nNo solutions for P=6.\\n\\nP=7:\\n\\nC=R\\u00b2 -63 \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226564. R=8,9.\\n\\nR=8: C=64 -63=1\\n\\nQ=14 -11*1=3. Valid. Check if Q=3.\\n\\nCheck equation 11P - Q=11*7 -3=77 -3=74. Which should equal R\\u00b2=64. But 74\\u226064. Wait, conflict here.\\n\\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's check.\\n\\nWait, if P=7, R=8, then C= R\\u00b2 -9P=64 -63=1. Then Q=2P -11C=14 -11=3. Then the original equation 11P - Q=77 -3=74. But R\\u00b2=64. 74\\u226064. So this is invalid. Therefore, even though algebraically we found Q=3, it doesn't satisfy the original equation. Hence, this is a false solution.\\n\\nWait, why is this happening? Because in our approach, we derived equations assuming certain conditions, but we might have missed some constraints.\\n\\nWait, let's recall that in this case, we started with:\\n\\n( R\\u00b2 -9P )*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nBut when we substitute k=2, P=7, R=8, Q=3:\\n\\nLeft side: (64 -63)*100=1*100=100\\n\\nRight side:9*7 -9*3 +64=63 -27 +64=100\\n\\nSo 100=100. So equation holds.\\n\\nBut according to the original equation:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)}=(R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nHere, k=2. So:\\n\\nP_{(4)}=7777\\n\\nQ_{(2)}=33\\n\\nR_{(2)}=88\\n\\nCheck:\\n\\n7777 -33=7744\\n\\n88\\u00b2=7744. Correct.\\n\\nBut according to digits, Q=3 is valid, R=8 is valid. So this quadruple (7,3,8,2) is valid. Wait, but according to our earlier notation, (P,Q,R,k)=(7,3,8,2). But in our calculation, we had Q=3. So where is the discrepancy?\\n\\nWait, when we solved Q=2P -11C=14 -11=3, which gives Q=3. So (P,Q,R,k)=(7,3,8,2). But when we check the original equation, it works. So why did we get confused earlier?\\n\\nBecause when we checked 11P - Q=77 -3=74\\u226064=R\\u00b2. But this seems contradictory. Wait, but in this case, the equation we solved was not 11P - Q=R\\u00b2, but rather a different equation. Wait, no. Let's recall how we arrived here.\\n\\nIn the case where A is negative (A=9P - R\\u00b2 <0) and B positive, we derived that:\\n\\n( R\\u00b2 -9P )*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nWhich, for k=2, P=7, R=8, Q=3, gives:\\n\\n(64 -63)*100=63 -27 +64 \\u21d21*100=100=100, which is true.\\n\\nBut the equation 11P - Q=R\\u00b2 was derived in the previous case (A positive, B negative), which doesn't apply here. Therefore, in this case, we don't have 11P - Q=R\\u00b2. Instead, we have a different relationship. Therefore, the solution (7,3,8,2) is valid, even though 11P - Q \\u2260 R\\u00b2.\\n\\nWait, this is a critical point. In the case where A is negative and B is positive, the relationship between P, Q, R, k is different from the previous case. So in this case, the equation ( R\\u00b2 -9P )*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 is the key equation, not 11P - Q=R\\u00b2. Therefore, the solution (7,3,8,2) is valid even though 11*7 -3=74\\u226064=8\\u00b2. Because that equation was specific to the other case.\\n\\nTherefore, our earlier confusion was unfounded. The solution (7,3,8,2) is valid. So, let's continue.\\n\\nSo for P=7, R=8, C=1:\\n\\nQ=2*7 -11*1=14 -11=3. Valid. So quadruple (7,3,8,2). Check:\\n\\nP_{(4)}=7777, Q_{(2)}=33, R_{(2)}=88\\n\\n7777 -33=7744. 88\\u00b2=7744. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, for R=9, P=7:\\n\\nC=81 -63=18\\n\\nQ=14 -11*18=14 -198= -184. Invalid.\\n\\nSo only R=8 gives a valid solution for P=7, k=2.\\n\\nNext, P=8:\\n\\nC=R\\u00b2 -72 \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226573. R=9 (R\\u00b2=81)\\n\\nC=81 -72=9\\n\\nQ=2*8 -11*9=16 -99= -83. Invalid.\\n\\nP=9:\\n\\nC=R\\u00b2 -81 \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226582. But R is at most9, R\\u00b2=81. So no solution.\\n\\nTherefore, for k=2, we have one solution: (7,3,8,2)\\n\\nSimilarly, check for k=3.\\n\\nFor k=3, S_3=111.\\n\\nEquation:\\n\\nC *111=2P -Q \\u21d2Q=2P -111C\\n\\nQ must be 1-9:\\n\\n1 \\u22642P -111C \\u22649\\n\\nSince C\\u22651 and integer, 111C \\u2265111. So 2P -111C \\u22651 \\u21d22P \\u2265111C +1 \\u2265112 \\u21d2P\\u226556. But P is a digit (1-9). Impossible. Therefore, no solutions for k\\u22653.\\n\\nSimilarly, for k\\u22653, S_k is too large, making Q=2P - S_k*C negative or exceeding 9. Therefore, only k=1 and k=2 may have solutions in this case.\\n\\nBut wait, for k=2, we had one solution: (7,3,8,2). Let's check if there are solutions for k=2 and other P values.\\n\\nWait, we already checked P=6 to9 for k=2. For P=7, we found one solution. P=8,9: no solution. Let's check P=5:\\n\\nBut earlier, for k=2, we considered P\\u22656. Because C=R\\u00b2 -9P \\u22651. So R\\u00b2 \\u22659P +1. For P=5:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 \\u226546. Possible R=7 (49),8 (64),9(81). Let's try.\\n\\nFor P=5, R=7:\\n\\nC=49 -45=4\\n\\nQ=2*5 -11*4=10 -44= -34. Invalid.\\n\\nR=8:\\n\\nC=64 -45=19\\n\\nQ=10 -11*19=10 -209= -199. Invalid.\\n\\nR=9:\\n\\nC=81 -45=36\\n\\nQ=10 -11*36=10 -396= -386. Invalid.\\n\\nNo solutions.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=4:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 \\u226537. R=7,8,9.\\n\\nC= R\\u00b2 -36.\\n\\nFor R=7:\\n\\nC=49 -36=13\\n\\nQ=8 -11*13=8 -143= -135. Invalid.\\n\\nSimilarly, no solutions.\\n\\nTherefore, only solution for k=2 is (7,3,8,2).\\n\\nSimilarly, check for k=2, P=7, R=8. We already did that.\\n\\nTherefore, in Case2 (A negative, B positive), we have solutions:\\n\\nFor k=1:\\n\\n- (5,6,7,1)\\n\\n- (6,2,8,1)\\n\\n- (8,7,9,1)\\n\\nFor k=2:\\n\\n- (7,3,8,2)\\n\\nTotal of4 solutions from Case2.\\n\\nAdditionally, in Case1 (A positive, B negative), we had three solutions:\\n\\n- (1,7,2,1)\\n\\n- (2,6,4,1)\\n\\n- (3,8,5,1)\\n\\nAnd in the A=0 and B=0 case, two solutions valid for all k:\\n\\n- (1,2,3,k) for k=1 to2018\\n\\n- (4,8,6,k) for k=1 to2018\\n\\nTherefore, total N is:\\n\\n- From A=0, B=0: 2*2018=4036\\n\\n- From Case1 (A>0,B<0):3*1=3\\n\\n- From Case2 (A<0,B>0):4*1=4\\n\\nBut wait, in Case2, for k=2, we have one solution, but in k=1, three solutions, totaling four solutions. So total N=4036 +3 +4=4043.\\n\\nBut wait, need to check if there are more solutions for k=2 in Case2.\\n\\nWait, for k=2, we only found one solution: (7,3,8,2). For other P and R?\\n\\nWait, perhaps check P=4, k=2.\\n\\nWait, but earlier steps showed that for k=2, only P=7 gives a valid solution. So total solutions in Case2 are:\\n\\nk=1:3 solutions\\n\\nk=2:1 solution\\n\\nTotal:4\\n\\nTherefore, N=4036 +3 +4=4043.\\n\\nBut let's verify each solution:\\n\\nFrom A=0 and B=0:\\n\\n- (1,2,3,k) for k=1 to2018:2018 quadruples\\n\\n- (4,8,6,k) for k=1 to2018:2018 quadruples\\n\\nTotal:4036\\n\\nFrom Case1 (A>0,B<0):\\n\\n- (1,7,2,1)\\n\\n- (2,6,4,1)\\n\\n- (3,8,5,1)\\n\\nTotal:3\\n\\nFrom Case2 (A<0,B>0):\\n\\n- (5,6,7,1)\\n\\n- (6,2,8,1)\\n\\n- (8,7,9,1)\\n\\n- (7,3,8,2)\\n\\nTotal:4\\n\\nWait, but earlier in Case2 (A<0,B>0), we had:\\n\\nFor k=1: (5,6,7,1), (6,2,8,1), (8,7,9,1)\\n\\nFor k=2: (7,3,8,2)\\n\\nTotal 4.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo total N=4036 +3 +4=4043.\\n\\nBut let's verify the solution (5,6,7,1):\\n\\nP=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1\\n\\nCheck:\\n\\n5_{(2)}=55, 6_{(1)}=6, 7_{(1)}=7\\n\\n55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, (6,2,8,1):\\n\\n6_{(2)}=66,2_{(1)}=2,8_{(1)}=8\\n\\n66 -2=64=8\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\n(8,7,9,1):\\n\\n8_{(2)}=88,7_{(1)}=7,9_{(1)}=9\\n\\n88 -7=81=9\\u00b2.

Correct.\\n\\nSo all these solutions are valid.\\n\\nThus, total N=4036 +3 +4=4043.\\n\\nBut let's check if there are any other solutions in Case2 for k=2. For example, if P=7, R=8, k=2 gives one solution. What about P= other values?\\n\\nFor k=2, we saw that only P=7 gives a solution. For example, if P=8, R=9, then C=81 -72=9, Q=2*8 -11*9=16 -99=-83 invalid.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=9, no solution.\\n\\nTherefore, only one solution for k=2.\\n\\nThus, N=4043.\\n\\nNow, compute the sum of the digits of N=4043.\\n\\nDigits:4,0,4,3.

The problem is about finding the number of quadruples (P, Q, R, k) where P, Q, R are positive digits (so 1 through 9) and k is a positive integer with k \\u2264 2018. The condition given is that P_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2. Then, we need to find the sum of the digits of N, where N is the number of such quadruples.\\n\\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the notation correctly. The symbol D_{(k)} represents a number with k digits, all equal to D. For example, 3_{(4)} is 3333. So, P_{(2k)} is a number with 2k digits, all P's. Similarly, Q_{(k)} is a number with k digits, all Q's, and R_{(k)} is a number with k digits, all R's. The equation given is:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nSo, we need to find all quadruples (P, Q, R, k) satisfying this equation with the constraints on P, Q, R (they are digits from 1 to 9) and k \\u2264 2018.\\n\\nLet me start by expressing each term in the equation numerically. Let's denote:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} = P * (10^{2k - 1} + 10^{2k - 2} + ... + 10^0) = P * ( (10^{2k} - 1)/9 )\\n\\nSimilarly, Q_{(k)} = Q * ( (10^{k} - 1)/9 )\\n\\nAnd R_{(k)} = R * ( (10^{k} - 1)/9 )\\n\\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\\n\\nP * ( (10^{2k} - 1)/9 ) - Q * ( (10^{k} - 1)/9 ) = [ R * ( (10^{k} - 1)/9 ) ]\\u00b2\\n\\nLet me simplify this equation step by step. First, multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators:\\n\\nP * (10^{2k} - 1) - Q * (10^{k} - 1) = [ R * (10^{k} - 1) ]\\u00b2 / 81\\n\\nWait, actually, let's check that again. The original equation:\\n\\nLeft side: P_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = [R_{(k)}]^2\\n\\nExpressed in terms of numbers:\\n\\nLeft side: P*( (10^{2k} - 1)/9 ) - Q*( (10^{k} - 1)/9 )\\n\\nRight side: [ R*( (10^{k} - 1)/9 ) ]\\u00b2\\n\\nSo, if we multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators on the left:\\n\\nLeft side becomes: P*(10^{2k} - 1) - Q*(10^{k} - 1)\\n\\nRight side becomes: [ R*(10^{k} - 1) ]\\u00b2 / 9\\n\\nWait, because the right side was [ R*( (10^k -1)/9 ) ]\\u00b2, so expanding that:\\n\\n= R\\u00b2 * (10^k -1)^2 / 81\\n\\nTherefore, multiplying both sides by 9 gives:\\n\\nLeft side: P*(10^{2k} -1) - Q*(10^k -1)\\n\\nRight side: R\\u00b2 * (10^k -1)^2 / 9\\n\\nHmm, maybe instead of multiplying by 9, let's rearrange the equation:\\n\\nLet me write the equation again:\\n\\nP*( (10^{2k} -1)/9 ) - Q*( (10^k -1)/9 ) = [ R*( (10^k -1)/9 ) ]\\u00b2\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 81 to eliminate all denominators:\\n\\n9P*(10^{2k} -1) - 9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9P*(10^{2k} -1) - 9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nLet me factor the left side. Note that 10^{2k} -1 factors as (10^k -1)(10^k +1). So:\\n\\n9P*(10^k -1)(10^k +1) - 9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nFactor out (10^k -1) on the left:\\n\\n(10^k -1)[9P*(10^k +1) -9Q] = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nDivide both sides by (10^k -1), assuming 10^k -1 \\u2260 0, which it isn't since k is a positive integer:\\n\\n9P*(10^k +1) -9Q = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)\\n\\nLet me write this as:\\n\\n9P*10^k + 9P -9Q = R\\u00b2*10^k - R\\u00b2\\n\\nBring all terms to one side:\\n\\n9P*10^k +9P -9Q - R\\u00b2*10^k + R\\u00b2 = 0\\n\\nFactor terms with 10^k:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2) = 0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2) = 0\\n\\nLet me rearrange this equation:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k = - (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2)\\n\\nNote that the left side is (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k and the right side is - (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2). Let's denote:\\n\\nLeft side: (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k\\n\\nRight side: -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k = -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2\\n\\nLet me write this equation as:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k +9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 =0\\n\\nBut perhaps another approach would be better. Let's consider that 10^k is a very large number compared to the other terms when k is large. Since k can be up to 2018, 10^k is enormous. Therefore, the term (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k must be balanced by the term -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2. However, since 10^k is so large, unless (9P - R\\u00b2) is zero, the left side would be either extremely large positive or negative, which can't be balanced by the other terms. Therefore, likely (9P - R\\u00b2) must be zero. Let me check that.\\n\\nSuppose 9P - R\\u00b2 = 0. Then:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 =9P\\n\\nTherefore, R\\u00b2 must be divisible by 9, so R must be 3, 6, or 9, since R is a digit from 1 to 9. Then:\\n\\nIf R=3, then 9P =9*1 => P=1\\n\\nIf R=6, then 9P=36 => P=4\\n\\nIf R=9, then 9P=81 => P=9\\n\\nTherefore, possible (R, P) pairs are (3,1), (6,4), (9,9).\\n\\nIf 9P - R\\u00b2 =0, then the equation reduces to:\\n\\n0 +9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 =0\\n\\nBut since R\\u00b2=9P, substitute:\\n\\n9P -9Q +9P =0 => 18P -9Q=0 => 2P = Q\\n\\nSo Q=2P\\n\\nSince Q must be a positive digit (1-9), and P is also a digit (1-9), so possible values for P are such that 2P \\u22649. Therefore:\\n\\nIf P=1, Q=2\\n\\nP=2, Q=4\\n\\nP=3, Q=6\\n\\nP=4, Q=8\\n\\nP=5, Q=10 which is invalid since Q must be a digit (1-9). Similarly for P=6, Q=12 invalid, etc. So only P=1,2,3,4 with Q=2,4,6,8 respectively.\\n\\nBut earlier, we had R\\u00b2=9P, so R is determined by P. Let's tabulate the possible quadruples (P, Q, R, k):\\n\\nFor each valid P (1,2,3,4), Q=2P, R such that R\\u00b2=9P. Let's see:\\n\\nCase 1: P=1, Q=2, R\\u00b2=9*1=9 \\u21d2 R=3. So quadruple (1,2,3,k). But since 9P - R\\u00b2=0, the equation holds for any k? Wait, hold on. If 9P - R\\u00b2=0, then the original equation reduces to 0 +9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=0, which we already satisfied by Q=2P. Therefore, if 9P - R\\u00b2=0, then the equation holds for any k? Wait, let's check.\\n\\nWait, when we set 9P - R\\u00b2=0, then the equation becomes:\\n\\n(0)*10^k +9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=0\\n\\nBut since R\\u00b2=9P, this becomes 0 +9P -9Q +9P=0 \\u21d2 18P -9Q=0 \\u21d2 Q=2P, which is already satisfied. Therefore, for these values of P, Q, R, the equation holds for any k. Therefore, for each such quadruple (P, Q, R), all k from 1 to 2018 would satisfy the equation. Therefore, the number of quadruples in this case is 4 (since P=1,2,3,4) each with k from 1 to 2018. So 4*2018.\\n\\nBut wait, R must be a positive digit. For R=3,6,9, which are all valid digits. So for P=1, R=3; P=2, R=6? Wait, wait. Wait R\\u00b2=9P. So:\\n\\nWait, if R\\u00b2=9P, then for P=1, R\\u00b2=9*1=9 \\u21d2 R=3\\n\\nFor P=2, R\\u00b2=18, which is not a perfect square. Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on. Wait, I thought R\\u00b2=9P. So:\\n\\nWait, when 9P - R\\u00b2=0, then R\\u00b2=9P. Therefore, R must be a multiple of 3, since R\\u00b2 is divisible by 9. So R=3,6,9. Then:\\n\\nIf R=3, R\\u00b2=9=9*1 \\u21d2 P=1\\n\\nIf R=6, R\\u00b2=36=9*4 \\u21d2 P=4\\n\\nIf R=9, R\\u00b2=81=9*9 \\u21d2 P=9\\n\\nTherefore, only P=1,4,9 are possible here. Wait, this contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, let's recast:\\n\\nIf R\\u00b2=9P, then since R is a digit (1-9), R can be 3,6,9 because their squares are 9,36,81, which must equal 9P. Therefore:\\n\\nFor R=3: 9=9P \\u21d2 P=1\\n\\nFor R=6: 36=9P \\u21d2 P=4\\n\\nFor R=9: 81=9P \\u21d2 P=9\\n\\nTherefore, only P=1,4,9 are possible here, with corresponding R=3,6,9. Then Q=2P must be an integer digit. So:\\n\\nFor P=1: Q=2*1=2 (valid)\\n\\nFor P=4: Q=2*4=8 (valid)\\n\\nFor P=9: Q=2*9=18 (invalid, since Q must be a digit from 1-9)\\n\\nTherefore, only P=1 and P=4 are valid here. So the possible quadruples are:\\n\\n(P=1, Q=2, R=3, k) for any k \\u22642018\\n\\n(P=4, Q=8, R=6, k) for any k \\u22642018\\n\\nSo that's two quadruples for each k. Therefore, for each k from 1 to 2018, there are two quadruples. So total N from this case is 2*2018.\\n\\nWait, but wait, when P=9, Q=18 is invalid, so that's not allowed. So only two possible (P, Q, R) combinations where 9P - R\\u00b2=0, leading to valid digits. Therefore, each of these two (P, Q, R) combinations can be paired with any k from 1 to 2018, giving 2*2018 quadruples.\\n\\nBut let's check if this is indeed correct. Let's take an example. Let's take k=1.\\n\\nFor k=1:\\n\\nP=1, Q=2, R=3\\n\\nSo P_{(2k)} =11, Q_{(k)}=2, R_{(k)}=3\\n\\nSo 11 -2=9, which is 3\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, for k=1, P=4, Q=8, R=6:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=44, Q_{(1)}=8, R_{(1)}=6\\n\\n44 -8=36=6\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, for k=2:\\n\\nP=1, Q=2, R=3:\\n\\nP_{(4)}=1111, Q_{(2)}=22, R_{(2)}=33\\n\\n1111 -22=1089=33\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=4, Q=8, R=6:\\n\\nP_{(4)}=4444, Q_{(2)}=88, R_{(2)}=66\\n\\n4444 -88=4356=66\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSo yes, these work for any k. Therefore, these two quadruples (with P=1, Q=2, R=3 and P=4, Q=8, R=6) work for all k from 1 to 2018, giving 2*2018=4036 quadruples.\\n\\nBut wait, earlier, when I considered R=9, P=9, Q=18, which is invalid. So only two possibilities here.\\n\\nBut now, the problem is, are there other solutions where 9P - R\\u00b2 \\u22600? Because the previous reasoning assumed that 9P - R\\u00b2 must be zero, otherwise the term (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k would be enormous, but maybe for small k, this term isn't that big? Let's check.\\n\\nSuppose 9P - R\\u00b2 \\u22600. Then the equation is:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k = -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2\\n\\nNote that the left side is (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k, which is either a large positive or negative number, while the right side is -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2, which is a number between, say, -9*9 +9*9 -9*9 = -81 +81 -81 = -81, and 9*9 -9*1 -1*1=81 -9 -1=71. So the right side is between -81 and 81, approximately.\\n\\nBut 10^k grows exponentially. For k=1, 10^1=10; for k=2, 100; k=3, 1000; etc. So unless (9P - R\\u00b2)=0, the left side will be either very large positive or negative, which cannot equal the right side (which is at most 81 in absolute value). Therefore, for k \\u22651, unless 9P - R\\u00b2=0, there are no solutions. Therefore, the only solutions are those where 9P - R\\u00b2=0, and hence Q=2P, as we found earlier. Therefore, only the two quadruples (P=1, Q=2, R=3, k) and (P=4, Q=8, R=6, k) for each k from 1 to 2018. So total N=2*2018=4036.\\n\\nWait, but hold on. Let's check k=1. For k=1, we have:\\n\\nEquation: P_{(2)} - Q_{(1)} = (R_{(1)})\\u00b2\\n\\nWhich is 11P - Q = R\\u00b2\\n\\nBut in our previous analysis, we have two possibilities:\\n\\nCase 1: 9P - R\\u00b2=0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2=9P. So R=3, P=1; R=6, P=4; R=9, P=9 (invalid). Then Q=2P. So for k=1, let's see:\\n\\nFor P=1, Q=2, R=3: 11*1 -2=9=3\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nFor P=4, Q=8, R=6: 11*4 -8=44-8=36=6\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nBut wait, 11*P - Q= R\\u00b2. But according to the equation, when k=1:\\n\\nP_{(2k)}=P_{(2)}=11*P (if P is a digit, but actually, P_{(2)} is a two-digit number with both digits P. So for example, P=1, P_{(2)}=11; P=4, P_{(2)}=44. Similarly, Q_{(1)}=Q. And R_{(1)}=R. So the equation is:\\n\\nFor k=1, P_{(2)} - Q = R\\u00b2.\\n\\nSo for example, P=1: 11 - Q = R\\u00b2. Then, if R=3, 11 - Q=9 \\u21d2 Q=2. Which is valid.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=4: 44 - Q = R\\u00b2. If R=6, 44 - Q=36 \\u21d2 Q=8. Valid.\\n\\nBut wait, if we didn't have the constraint 9P - R\\u00b2=0, could there be other solutions? For example, suppose P=2. Then, 22 - Q = R\\u00b2. Q and R are digits. So R\\u00b2 must be 22 - Q. Since Q is from 1-9, R\\u00b2 is from 13 to 21. But 13,14,...,21 are not perfect squares. So no solution here.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=3: 33 - Q = R\\u00b2. R\\u00b2 must be 33 - Q, which is 24 to 32. No squares there.\\n\\nP=5: 55 - Q = R\\u00b2. 55 - Q ranges from 46 to 54. 49 is a square (7\\u00b2=49). So if Q=6, 55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. So R=7. Wait, but according to our previous analysis, this shouldn't be a solution. Because according to our earlier reasoning, solutions only exist when 9P - R\\u00b2=0, but here, 9*5 - 7\\u00b2=45 -49=-4\\u22600. So this seems to be a contradiction.\\n\\nWait, but hold on. If P=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1:\\n\\nCheck the equation: P_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nSo, for k=1: 55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct. So this is a valid solution. But according to our previous reasoning, this shouldn't exist. Therefore, our earlier assumption that 9P - R\\u00b2 must be zero is incorrect. Therefore, there are solutions where 9P - R\\u00b2 \\u22600. Therefore, our previous reasoning was flawed.\\n\\nTherefore, we need to re-examine the problem.\\n\\nSo, let's start over. The equation is:\\n\\n9P*(10^{2k} -1) -9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Let me write the original equation again:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nExpressed numerically:\\n\\nP*(10^{2k} -1)/9 - Q*(10^k -1)/9 = [ R*(10^k -1)/9 ]\\u00b2\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 81:\\n\\n9P*(10^{2k} -1) -9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nLet me denote x = 10^k. Then, 10^{2k} = x\\u00b2. So the equation becomes:\\n\\n9P*(x\\u00b2 -1) -9Q*(x -1) = R\\u00b2*(x -1)^2\\n\\nFactor left side:\\n\\n9P*(x -1)(x +1) -9Q*(x -1) = R\\u00b2*(x -1)^2\\n\\nFactor out (x -1):\\n\\n(x -1)[9P(x +1) -9Q] = R\\u00b2*(x -1)^2\\n\\nAssuming x \\u22601 (which is true since x=10^k \\u226510), we can divide both sides by (x -1):\\n\\n9P(x +1) -9Q = R\\u00b2*(x -1)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9P(x +1) - R\\u00b2x + R\\u00b2 -9Q =0\\n\\nWait, perhaps rearrange terms:\\n\\n9P*x +9P - R\\u00b2*x + R\\u00b2 -9Q =0\\n\\nGroup terms with x:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x + (9P + R\\u00b2 -9Q)=0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x +9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2=0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x = -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2\\n\\nNote that x=10^k, which is a positive integer power of 10. So x must be a positive integer, and in our case, k is a positive integer \\u22642018, so x=10^k is an integer from 10 to 10^{2018}.\\n\\nBut since x is huge for large k, the left side (9P - R\\u00b2)x is either very large positive or negative, while the right side is -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2, which is bounded because P, Q, R are digits (1-9). Let's see:\\n\\nThe right side:\\n\\n-9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2\\n\\nSince P and Q are digits from 1-9, 9(P - Q) can range from -72 (if P=1, Q=9) to 72 (if P=9, Q=1). Then, -9(P - Q) ranges from -72 to 72. Then subtract R\\u00b2, which is 1-81. So the entire right side ranges from -72 -81= -153 to 72 -1=71. So the right side is between -153 and 71.\\n\\nBut the left side is (9P - R\\u00b2)x, where x=10^k \\u226510. So (9P - R\\u00b2) multiplied by at least 10. Therefore, unless 9P - R\\u00b2=0, the left side will have absolute value \\u226510*|9P - R\\u00b2|. Since 9P - R\\u00b2 can be from 9*1 -1\\u00b2=8 to 9*9 -9\\u00b2=0. Wait, but R is a digit from 1-9, so R\\u00b2 can be from 1 to 81, and 9P is from 9 to 81. So 9P - R\\u00b2 can range from 9*1 -9=0 to 9*9 -1=80. So 9P - R\\u00b2 can be between 0 and 80.\\n\\nWait, but if 9P - R\\u00b2 is positive, then (9P - R\\u00b2)x is positive, but the right side is -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2, which can be positive or negative. However, if 9P - R\\u00b2 is positive, then the left side is positive, but the right side can be at most 71. So:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x = negative number - R\\u00b2. Wait, the right side is -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2. If P < Q, then -9(P - Q) is positive, so the right side is positive minus R\\u00b2. If P \\u2265 Q, then -9(P - Q) is negative or zero, so the right side is negative - R\\u00b2, which is negative.\\n\\nBut the left side is (9P - R\\u00b2)x, which is positive (since 9P - R\\u00b2 \\u22650 if P \\u2265 R\\u00b2/9. For example, if P=1, R\\u00b2 \\u22649; R=1,2,3. If P=2, R\\u00b2 \\u226418; R=1-4 (since 4\\u00b2=16 <18). Wait, but R is a digit up to 9. Wait, 9P - R\\u00b2 can be positive or negative.\\n\\nWait, actually, 9P - R\\u00b2 can range from:\\n\\nFor P=1: 9*1 - R\\u00b2. R can be 1-9. So 9 -1=8, 9-4=5, ..., 9-81= -72.\\n\\nSimilarly, for P=9: 81 - R\\u00b2. R can be 1-9. So 81-1=80, ..., 81-81=0.\\n\\nTherefore, 9P - R\\u00b2 can be both positive and negative. Therefore, the left side (9P - R\\u00b2)x can be positive or negative. However, x=10^k is positive, so the sign of the left side is the same as the sign of (9P - R\\u00b2).\\n\\nBut the right side is -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2. Let's analyze possible cases.\\n\\nCase 1: 9P - R\\u00b2 =0. Then, as before, the equation reduces to 0 = -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2. But since 9P - R\\u00b2=0, R\\u00b2=9P. Therefore:\\n\\n-9(P - Q) -9P =0 \\u21d2 -9P +9Q -9P=0 \\u21d2 -18P +9Q=0 \\u21d2 2P=Q. So Q=2P. As before.\\n\\nBut when 9P - R\\u00b2=0, we have solutions for any k, as the equation reduces to an identity. But we saw that for k=1, there are other solutions where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, like P=5, Q=6, R=7. So how does that fit in?\\n\\nWait, in that case, for k=1, x=10. Let's plug into the equation:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x +9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2=0\\n\\nSo for P=5, Q=6, R=7, x=10:\\n\\n(45 -49)*10 +9*(5 -6) +49= (-4)*10 +9*(-1) +49= -40 -9 +49=0. Correct.\\n\\nSo even though 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, the equation holds. So how?\\n\\nBecause the term (9P - R\\u00b2)x is balanced by the other terms. So even for k=1, x=10, which is not extremely large, so the left side (9P - R\\u00b2)x is not negligible. But in this case, (9*5 -7\\u00b2)*10= (45 -49)*10= (-4)*10= -40, and the other terms 9*(5 -6) +49= -9 +49=40, so total -40 +40=0.\\n\\nSo in this case, the two parts cancel each other. Therefore, even for k=1, there can be solutions where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600. Therefore, our initial assumption that only solutions with 9P - R\\u00b2=0 exist is incorrect. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities: when 9P - R\\u00b2=0 and when it's not.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of quadruples is the sum of:\\n\\n1. The number of quadruples where 9P - R\\u00b2=0, which gives Q=2P, and valid P=1,4,9 (but Q must be a digit, so P=1,4 only). For each of these, k can be from 1 to 2018. So 2*2018.\\n\\n2. The number of quadruples where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, but the equation (9P - R\\u00b2)x +9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2=0 holds for some x=10^k, k \\u22642018. For these cases, x must be an integer (specifically, x=10^k), so we need to solve for x:\\n\\nx = [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 )\\n\\nBut x must be equal to 10^k for some integer k \\u22642018. Therefore, for each possible (P, Q, R) where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, we can compute x and check if it is a power of 10, and if so, check if k= log_10(x) is an integer \\u22642018.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem reduces to two parts:\\n\\n- Counting quadruples where 9P - R\\u00b2=0 (already found: 2*2018=4036)\\n\\n- Counting quadruples where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600 but x= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 ) is a power of 10, i.e., x=10^k for some k \\u22642018.\\n\\nTherefore, we need to find all (P, Q, R) with P,Q,R digits, 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, and such that [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 ) =10^k for some k.\\n\\nTherefore, for each possible (P, Q, R), compute x= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 ) and check if x is a positive integer power of 10, and if so, check if k= log_10(x) is an integer \\u22642018. For each such valid (P, Q, R, k), we have a quadruple.\\n\\nSo, first, let's handle the first case: 9P - R\\u00b2=0. As established, this gives two quadruples for each k, so 2*2018=4036.\\n\\nNow, the second case: 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600. Let's analyze the equation:\\n\\nx= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 ) =10^k\\n\\nNote that x must be positive because x=10^k >0. Therefore, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign. So:\\n\\nEither:\\n\\n1. -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 >0 and 9P - R\\u00b2 >0\\n\\nOr\\n\\n2. -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 <0 and 9P - R\\u00b2 <0\\n\\nLet's analyze both possibilities.\\n\\nCase 1: Both numerator and denominator positive.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n-9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d2 -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d29Q >9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nand\\n\\n9P - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d29P > R\\u00b2\\n\\nTherefore, in this case, we have 9P > R\\u00b2 and 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2. Since Q is a digit (1-9), 9Q \\u226481. So 9P + R\\u00b2 <81. But since 9P > R\\u00b2, let's see:\\n\\nFrom 9P > R\\u00b2, we have R\\u00b2 <9P. Therefore, substituting into the second inequality:\\n\\n9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 >9P + R\\u00b2 (since R\\u00b2 <9P) but wait, 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2, but R\\u00b2 <9P, so 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 >9P +0=9P. Therefore, 9Q >9P \\u21d2 Q >P.\\n\\nSo in this case, Q >P. Also, since 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 and R\\u00b2 <9P, we can write:\\n\\n9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 \\u21d2 Q >P + R\\u00b2/9\\n\\nBut R\\u00b2 <9P \\u21d2 R\\u00b2/9 <P. Therefore, Q >P + (something less than P). But since Q is at most 9, and P is at least 1, this might not give us much.\\n\\nBut let's consider that x=10^k must be an integer. So x= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 )\\n\\nBut in this case, numerator and denominator are positive. Let's denote:\\n\\nNumerator=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2\\n\\nDenominator=9P - R\\u00b2\\n\\nTherefore, x= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ]\\n\\nWe need this fraction to be equal to 10^k. Let's denote:\\n\\n[9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ] =10^k\\n\\nLet me rearrange this equation:\\n\\n9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 =10^k*(9P - R\\u00b2 )\\n\\nLet me write this as:\\n\\n9Q -9P - R\\u00b2 =9*10^k P -10^k R\\u00b2\\n\\nBring all terms to one side:\\n\\n9Q -9P - R\\u00b2 -9*10^k P +10^k R\\u00b2=0\\n\\nFactor terms with P and R\\u00b2:\\n\\nP*( -9 -9*10^k ) + R\\u00b2*( -1 +10^k ) +9Q=0\\n\\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, rearrange terms:\\n\\n9Q =9*10^k P -10^k R\\u00b2 +9P + R\\u00b2 - R\\u00b2\\n\\nWait, maybe not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, group terms with P and R\\u00b2:\\n\\n9Q =9P(10^k +1) - R\\u00b2(10^k -1)\\n\\nBut perhaps this is not helpful either.\\n\\nAlternatively, let's consider that x=10^k, which is a power of 10, so it's 1 followed by k zeros. Therefore, x=10^k= (10^k). So x is an integer with k+1 digits: a 1 followed by k zeros.\\n\\nBut the fraction [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ] must equal this. Therefore, unless the numerator is a multiple of the denominator, x won't be an integer. Therefore, we need:\\n\\n[9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] \\u22610 mod [9P - R\\u00b2 ]\\n\\nBut this seems tricky. Let's take the example we had earlier: P=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1.\\n\\nCheck if this fits into the equation:\\n\\nx= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ] = [9*(6 -5) -49 ]/[45 -49 ]= [9 -49]/[-4]= (-40)/(-4)=10=10^1. So x=10, which is 10^1. Therefore, k=1. So this works.\\n\\nTherefore, in this case, x=10^1, which is 10. So this is a valid solution.\\n\\nTherefore, to find all such solutions, we need to find all triples (P, Q, R) where P, Q, R are digits, 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, and [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] divided by [9P - R\\u00b2 ] equals 10^k for some integer k \\u22651, and k \\u22642018.\\n\\nTherefore, for each possible (P, Q, R), we can compute x= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ] and check if x is a positive power of 10 (i.e., x=10,100,1000,..., up to 10^{2018}).\\n\\nBut since P, Q, R are digits from 1 to 9, there are 9*9*9=729 possible triples (P, Q, R). However, many of them will not satisfy the conditions. Let's see if we can find a smarter way.\\n\\nFirst, note that x=10^k must be an integer, so [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] must be divisible by [9P - R\\u00b2 ]. Let's denote:\\n\\nLet\\u2019s define numerator N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2\\n\\nDenominator D=9P - R\\u00b2\\n\\nTherefore, x= N/D=10^k\\n\\nTherefore, N= D*10^k\\n\\nTherefore, since D divides N, we have D divides N. So D divides N= D*10^k. Therefore, D divides N, which is trivially true. But since x=10^k, which is a power of 10, the prime factors of D must be only 2 and 5. However, D=9P - R\\u00b2. Let's see:\\n\\nD=9P - R\\u00b2. Since 9P and R\\u00b2 are both integers, D must be an integer. Also, since x=10^k>0, D and N must have the same sign. As we considered earlier, there are two cases: both positive or both negative.\\n\\nBut let's focus on the first case where D=9P - R\\u00b2 >0 and N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 >0. We saw an example where this leads to a solution. Let's see if there are other solutions.\\n\\nAlternatively, let's look for possible triples (P, Q, R) such that x=10^k.\\n\\nWe can start by checking possible values of P, R such that D=9P - R\\u00b2 is a divisor of N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2, and N/D=10^k.\\n\\nGiven that D divides N, and N/D=10^k, which is a power of 10, we can infer that D must be a factor of N, and the ratio N/D is a power of 10. Since 10^k is coprime with any factor of D that is not a factor of 10. Therefore, D must be composed of only factors 2 and 5, and possibly 1. But D=9P - R\\u00b2, which is 9P minus a square. Let's see.\\n\\nBut 9P - R\\u00b2 can be positive or negative. Let's first consider positive D.\\n\\nCase 1: D=9P - R\\u00b2 >0 and N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 >0.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9P - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 <9P\\n\\nand\\n\\n9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d29Q >9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nFrom R\\u00b2 <9P, substitute into the second inequality:\\n\\n9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 >9P +0=9P \\u21d29Q >9P \\u21d2Q >P\\n\\nSo Q >P in this case.\\n\\nAlso, since 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 and R\\u00b2 <9P, we can write:\\n\\n9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 \\u21d2 Q >P + R\\u00b2/9\\n\\nBut since R\\u00b2 <9P, R\\u00b2/9 <P. Therefore:\\n\\nQ >P + (something less than P)\\n\\nBut since Q is at most 9, and P is at least 1, this might not restrict much.\\n\\nBut let's think about possible values of D=9P - R\\u00b2. Since D divides N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2, we have:\\n\\n(9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ) / (9P - R\\u00b2 )=10^k\\n\\nLet me denote R\\u00b2 =9P -D. Then substituting into N:\\n\\nN=9(Q - P) - (9P -D)=9Q -9P -9P +D=9Q -18P +D\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\nN/D= (9Q -18P +D)/D= (9Q -18P)/D +1=10^k\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n(9Q -18P)/D=10^k -1\\n\\nBut D=9P - R\\u00b2= D, so:\\n\\n9Q -18P= D*(10^k -1)\\n\\nBut D=9P - R\\u00b2, so:\\n\\n9Q -18P= (9P - R\\u00b2)*(10^k -1)\\n\\nThis seems complicated. Maybe let's try specific values.\\n\\nTake the example we had earlier: P=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1.\\n\\nHere, D=9*5 -7\\u00b2=45 -49= -4. Wait, but in this case, D is negative. Wait, but in this example, we had:\\n\\nN=9*(6 -5) -49=9 -49= -40\\n\\nD=9*5 -49= -4\\n\\nSo x= (-40)/(-4)=10=10^1. So even though D and N are negative, their ratio is positive. So this is part of the other case where both numerator and denominator are negative.\\n\\nTherefore, in this case:\\n\\nCase 2: D=9P - R\\u00b2 <0 and N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 <0.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 >9P\\n\\nand\\n\\n9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d29Q -9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d29Q <9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nSince R\\u00b2 >9P, we have 9Q <9P + R\\u00b2 <9P + R\\u00b2. But since R\\u00b2 >9P, this implies 9Q < something larger than 9P. But Q can be less than or greater than P.\\n\\nBut let's consider this case. Let's denote D=9P - R\\u00b2 <0, so D= -|D|, and N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 <0.\\n\\nTherefore, x= N/D= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ]/[9P - R\\u00b2 ]= [negative]/[negative]=positive.\\n\\nSo x= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ]/[ - (R\\u00b2 -9P) ]= [9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2 ]/[ R\\u00b2 -9P ]\\n\\nThus, x= [9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2 ]/[ R\\u00b2 -9P ]=10^k\\n\\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\\n\\n[9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2 ]=10^k*( R\\u00b2 -9P )\\n\\nLet's rearrange:\\n\\n9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2=10^k R\\u00b2 -9*10^k P\\n\\nBring all terms to left:\\n\\n9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2 -10^k R\\u00b2 +9*10^k P=0\\n\\nFactor terms with R\\u00b2 and P:\\n\\nR\\u00b2(1 -10^k) +9P(1 +10^k) -9Q=0\\n\\nThis is similar to the previous equation.\\n\\nBut again, it's complex. However, we can use the example we had:\\n\\nP=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1.\\n\\nPlug into the equation:\\n\\nR\\u00b2(1 -10^1) +9*5*(1 +10^1) -9*6=49*(1 -10) +45*(11) -54=49*(-9) +495 -54= -441 +495 -54=0. Correct.\\n\\nTherefore, we need to find all triples (P, Q, R) such that this equation holds for some k.\\n\\nGiven that k must be a positive integer \\u22642018, and x=10^k, which is unique for each k, each solution (P, Q, R, k) must satisfy this equation for exactly one k.\\n\\nNow, the key is to find all such triples (P, Q, R) where the equation holds for some k, and then count the number of such quadruples (including the k values).\\n\\nBut since k is determined by the equation (k= log_10(x)), and x must be 10^k, we can for each valid (P, Q, R), compute x and check if it's a power of 10, and if so, check if k= log_10(x) is an integer \\u22642018.\\n\\nGiven that x= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ]/[9P - R\\u00b2 ]=10^k, we can precompute possible values of x and see if they correspond to powers of 10.\\n\\nBut since P, Q, R are digits from 1 to 9, let's try to find all possible triples (P, Q, R) that satisfy the equation.\\n\\nLet me consider possible values of R and P such that R\\u00b2 >9P (since D=9P - R\\u00b2 <0 in this case). For each R from 2 to 9 (since R=1 would give R\\u00b2=1 <9P for P\\u22651), and P from 1 to floor(R\\u00b2/9). For example:\\n\\nR=2: R\\u00b2=4. P must satisfy 9P <4 \\u21d2 P <4/9 \\u21d2 P=1 invalid since 9*1=9 >4. So R=2 cannot be used here.\\n\\nR=3: R\\u00b2=9. 9P <9 \\u21d2 P <1. No solution.\\n\\nR=4: R\\u00b2=16. 9P <16 \\u21d2 P <16/9\\u22481.78 \\u21d2 P=1.\\n\\nR=5: R\\u00b2=25. 9P <25 \\u21d2 P \\u22642 (since 9*2=18 <25, 9*3=27>25)\\n\\nR=6: R\\u00b2=36. 9P <36 \\u21d2 P <4 \\u21d2 P=1,2,3\\n\\nR=7: R\\u00b2=49. 9P <49 \\u21d2 P \\u22645 (9*5=45 <49)\\n\\nR=8: R\\u00b2=64. 9P <64 \\u21d2 P \\u22647 (9*7=63 <64)\\n\\nR=9: R\\u00b2=81. 9P <81 \\u21d2 P \\u22648 (9*8=72 <81)\\n\\nTherefore, for each R from 4 to 9, and P from 1 to floor(R\\u00b2/9), we can compute Q such that:\\n\\nx= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ]/[9P - R\\u00b2 ]=10^k\\n\\nBut since denominator is negative (D=9P - R\\u00b2 <0), and numerator must also be negative, we have:\\n\\n9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d29Q -9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d29Q <9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nBut since R\\u00b2 >9P, this is possible for Q in a certain range.\\n\\nLet me proceed step by step for each R from 4 to 9.\\n\\nCase R=4:\\n\\nR=4, R\\u00b2=16. P can be 1 (since 9*1=9 <16)\\n\\nSo P=1.\\n\\nWe need to find Q such that:\\n\\nx= [9(Q -1) -16 ]/[9*1 -16 ]= [9Q -9 -16]/[ -7 ]= (9Q -25)/(-7)=10^k\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n(9Q -25)/(-7)=10^k \\u21d2 (25 -9Q)/7=10^k\\n\\nSince 25 -9Q must be divisible by 7 and positive (since x=10^k >0).\\n\\nSo 25 -9Q >0 \\u21d29Q <25 \\u21d2Q \\u22642 (since 9*3=27 >25)\\n\\nQ can be 1 or 2.\\n\\nCheck Q=1:\\n\\n(25 -9*1)/7=16/7\\u22482.2857 Not integer.\\n\\nQ=2:\\n\\n(25 -18)/7=7/7=1=10^0. But k must be \\u22651. Therefore, invalid.\\n\\nTherefore, no solutions for R=4.\\n\\nCase R=5:\\n\\nR=5, R\\u00b2=25.

Wait, 6336 vs 704. Not equal. Wait, but earlier we saw that for k=2, 7777 -33=7744=88\\u00b2. Wait, but according to this equation:\\n\\nFor k=2:\\n\\n9999P -99Q =121R\\u00b2\\n\\nFor P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n9999*7 -99*3=69993 -297=69696\\n\\n121*8\\u00b2=121*64=7744. Wait, 69696 vs7744. Not equal. Wait, something's wrong here.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, the equation for k=2 is:\\n\\nP_{(4)} - Q_{(2)}= (R_{(2)})\\u00b2\\n\\nFor P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n7777 -33=7744=88\\u00b2.

This discrepancy arises because when we multiplied through by 9, we should have:\\n\\nOriginal equation:\\n\\nP_{(4)} - Q_{(2)}= (R_{(2)})\\u00b2\\n\\nWhich is:\\n\\n(1111*P) - (11*Q) = (11*R)^2\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n1111P -11Q =121R\\u00b2\\n\\nDivide both sides by 11:\\n\\n101P -Q =11R\\u00b2\\n\\nAh, that's the correct equation. So for P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n101*7 -3=707 -3=704\\n\\n11*8\\u00b2=704. Correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the equation is 101P -Q=11R\\u00b2.\\n\\nSo solving 101P -Q=11R\\u00b2 where P, Q, R are digits from 1-9.\\n\\nWe already have the solution P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n101*7 -3=707-3=704=11*64=11*8\\u00b2.\\n\\nAre there other solutions?\\n\\nLet's check for other R:\\n\\nR=1:11*1=11. 101P -Q=11.

Valid. So P=1, Q=2, R=3.\\n\\nCheck if this works:\\n\\nFor k=2: P=1, Q=2, R=3.\\n\\nP_{(4)}=1111, Q_{(2)}=22, R_{(2)}=33.\\n\\n1111 -22=1089=33\\u00b2. Correct. So this is another solution.\\n\\nBut wait, this solution was already counted in the first case where 9P - R\\u00b2=0. For P=1, R=3: 9*1 -9=0. So this solution is already included in the first case (k=2). Therefore, when k=2, this quadruple (1,2,3,2) is part of the first case.\\n\\nSimilarly, R=4:11*16=176. 101P -Q=176. P=2:202 -Q=176 \\u21d2Q=26. Invalid.\\n\\nR=5:11*25=275. 101P -Q=275. P=3:303 -Q=275 \\u21d2Q=28. Invalid.\\n\\nR=6:11*36=396. 101P -Q=396. P=4:404 -Q=396 \\u21d2Q=8. Valid. So P=4, Q=8, R=6.\\n\\nCheck this:\\n\\nFor k=2: P=4, Q=8, R=6.\\n\\nP_{(4)}=\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, the range is 18. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list. So, if I denote the smallest number as a and the largest as b, then b - a = 18. Since all numbers are positive integers, a must be at least 1, so b would be at least 19. But I need to check if that holds with the other conditions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The mode is 8. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. So, 8 must appear more times than any other number in the list. Since the median is 8, at least one 8 is present. To be the mode, 8 must appear at least twice. But it has to appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, then 8 must appear three times. But if no other number appears twice, then 8 can just appear twice. Wait, actually, the mode is the most frequent, so if 8 appears twice, then all other numbers can appear at most once. If another number appears twice, then 8 would have to appear three times to still be the mode. So, the number of 8s is at least two, and possibly more, depending on other numbers.\n",

    "Let me structure the list in order. Let's denote the five numbers in non-decreasing order as: a, x, 8, y, b. Here, a ≤ x ≤ 8 ≤ y ≤ b, and b - a = 18. Also, the total sum is a + x + 8 + y + b = 60. So, a + x + y + b = 52.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the mode is 8, 8 must appear at least twice. Since the median is 8, the third number is 8. So, at least one of x or y could be 8, but maybe more. Let's consider the possible number of 8s.\n",

    "Case 1: 8 appears exactly twice. Then, the two other numbers (a, x, y, b) can have at most one 8. But since the third element is 8, the first two elements (a and x) can be less than or equal to 8, and the last two (y and b) can be greater than or equal to 8. If we have exactly two 8s, then either x or y must be 8. Let's see:\n",

    "If the third element is 8, and there's exactly one more 8, then either x = 8 or y = 8. But if x = 8, then the list would be a, 8, 8, y, b. If y = 8, then the list would be a, x, 8, 8, b. However, in the first case, since the list is sorted, x = 8 would imply that the second element is 8, so a ≤ 8, x = 8. Then, y and b are ≥8. But if y is also 8, then there would be three 8s. But we are considering case with two 8s, so if x = 8, then y must be greater than 8. Similarly, if y = 8, then x must be less than 8. Wait, but if the third element is 8, and we have two 8s, then either x =8 and y >8, or y=8 and x <8. But if x=8 and y=8, that would be three 8s. So, in the case of two 8s, exactly one of x or y is 8, and the other is different. Wait, but if the third element is 8, x and y can be equal to 8 or not. Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have exactly two 8s. Then, the list must have two 8s and three distinct numbers. But since the median is 8, the third number is 8. So, possible configurations are:\n",

    "1. a, 8, 8, y, b where a <8 and y >8 (since if a =8, then all numbers after would be 8, leading to more than two 8s). Wait, but if a=8, then all numbers would be at least 8, but median is 8, so the first three numbers must be 8, but that would make three 8s. So, in the case of two 8s, the two 8s must be the third and either the second or fourth element. Wait, actually, the list is sorted, so if there are two 8s, the first 8 is at position 3, then the other 8 could be at position 2 or 4. But if the other 8 is at position 4, then the fifth element (b) would have to be ≥8, which it already is. But then, if y=8, then the fourth element is 8, so the fifth element (b) is ≥8, but if b is 8, then the range would be 0, which is not possible because the range is 18. So, actually, if we have two 8s, the configuration would be either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a, 8, 8, y, b where a <8, y ≥8 (but y must be >8 if we want exactly two 8s. If y=8, then there would be three 8s). So, y must be ≥9.\n",

    "\n",
    "- a, x, 8, 8, b where x <8, b ≥8 (but again, if x=8, that would lead to three 8s, so x must be <8). However, in this case, the fourth element is 8, so b must be ≥8, but since the range is 18, b = a +18. So, if a is less than 8, then b = a +18 would be at least 19 (if a=1), so definitely greater than 8. Thus, in this configuration, a, x, 8, 8, b where x <8 and b = a +18 ≥19. So, here, 8 appears twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but in this case, if x is also 8, then we have three 8s, so x must be less than 8. So, in both cases, when there are two 8s, the other 8 is either in position 2 or 4, but not both. So, either:\n",

    "1. a, 8, 8, y, b with a <8, y >8\n",

    "2. a, x, 8, 8, b with x <8, b >8 (since b = a +18, which is at least a +1 if a is at least 1, but given a <8, then a +18 is at least 19, so definitely >8)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, these are the two possibilities for two 8s. Now, in both cases, we have two 8s, and the rest of the numbers are distinct. So, in the first case, the numbers would be a, 8, 8, y, b with a <8, y >8, and all numbers distinct except for the two 8s. Similarly, in the second case, a, x, 8, 8, b with a <8, x <8, and b = a +18.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in this case, we have to ensure that no other number is repeated. For example, in the first case, a must be different from x and y and b. Wait, in the first case, the first element is a, the second is 8, third is 8, fourth is y, fifth is b. So, a must be less than 8, y must be greater than 8, and b must be a +18. Also, a must be different from 8, which it is. Then, since the mode is 8, which appears twice, all other numbers (a, y, b) must appear only once. So, if, for example, a is equal to y, then a and y would both be the same number, but that number is less than 8 (since a <8 and y >8). Wait, no, a is less than 8, y is greater than 8, so they can't be equal. Similarly, a and b can't be equal because b = a +18. Similarly, y and b: since y is at least 9 and b is a +18. If a is 1, then b is 19, y is at least 9, but y can be between 9 and 19. Wait, but y is the fourth element, so y ≤ b. So, y can be from 9 to b. But since b = a +18, and a is less than 8, then a can be from 1 to 7, so b ranges from 19 to 25. So, y can be from 9 up to 25, depending on a. Wait, but y is part of the list and must be an integer. Hmm.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the key point is, in the case of two 8s, the other numbers (a, x, y, b) must all be distinct. Wait, no, in the first case, the list is a, 8, 8, y, b. So, a, y, and b must be distinct? Not necessarily. For example, y and b could be equal. But since the list is sorted, y ≤ b, so if y = b, then the last two elements are both b. But in that case, the mode would be 8 and b. Since 8 appears twice and b appears twice, so there would be two modes, which contradicts the given that mode is 8. Therefore, y and b cannot be equal. Similarly, a and x could be equal in other configurations, but in this case, x is 8, which is different from a. So, in the first case, the numbers a, 8, 8, y, b must all be distinct except for the two 8s. Similarly, in the second case, a, x, 8, 8, b where a and x are distinct (since x <8 and a ≤x <8). So, if a and x are the same, then that number appears twice, which would conflict with the mode being 8. So, in order for 8 to be the unique mode, in the second case, a and x must be distinct. Therefore, in both cases of two 8s, all other numbers must appear only once. So, the two cases for two 8s are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a, 8, 8, y, b with a <8, y >8, a ≠ y, a ≠ b, y ≠ b, and all other numbers unique.\n",

    "2. a, x, 8, 8, b with a <x <8, b =a +18, and a ≠x, x ≠8, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the second case, the list is a, x, 8, 8, b. So, a and x are both less than 8, and distinct (since if a =x, then that number would appear twice, making it a mode alongside 8, but since 8 is supposed to be the only mode, a and x must be distinct. Therefore, in both cases, all other numbers are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe 8 appears three times. Let's consider that case.\n",

    "Case 2: 8 appears three times. Then, the list would be a, 8, 8, 8, b. Because with three 8s, the three middle numbers would be 8. So, a ≤8 and b ≥8. But since the range is 18, b -a =18. Also, the sum is a +8 +8 +8 +b =24 +a +b =60, so a +b =36. And since b =a +18, substituting into a +b =36 gives a + (a +18) =36 → 2a +18 =36 → 2a =18 → a=9. But a=9, then b=27. However, in this case, the list would be 9,8,8,8,27. But wait, the list must be in non-decreasing order. If a=9, the first element is 9, but then the second element is 8, which is less than 9. That's not possible because the list is supposed to be sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, this case is invalid. So, three 8s would require that a ≤8 and b ≥8, but also in sorted order. If we have three 8s, then the first number a must be ≤8, and the last number b must be ≥8. However, if the first three numbers are 8, then the list would be 8,8,8, y, b. But then the median is 8, which is okay, but the range is b -8=18, so b=26. Then, the sum would be 8+8+8+y+26=50 +y=60, so y=10. So, the list would be 8,8,8,10,26. In this case, the mode is 8 (appears three times), median is 8, mean is (8+8+8+10+26)/5=60/5=12, range is 26-8=18. So this works. So, this is a valid case. So, in this case, the list is 8,8,8,10,26, with the second largest number being 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but in this case, the first three numbers are 8, so the sorted list is [8,8,8,10,26]. The second largest element is 10. So, this is a valid configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this case, we have three 8s, and the other numbers are 10 and 26. But here, the three 8s make the mode 8, since no other number is repeated. So, this is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but if the three 8s are present, then the other two numbers (10 and 26) must not be repeated, otherwise they would have the same frequency as 8. So, in this case, 10 and 26 are unique, so mode is only 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, that works. Therefore, in this case, the second largest number is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this is another possible configuration where 8 appears three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "But earlier, when I tried putting a=9, which led to inconsistency in sorted order, but in reality, if we have three 8s, the first three elements are 8, so a=8. Then, the range would be b -8=18, so b=26. Then, the fourth element is y. The sum is 8+8+8+y+26=50 + y=60 ⇒ y=10. So, the list is [8,8,8,10,26], which is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this case, the second largest element is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, so far, in the three 8s case, the second largest is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's check if there are other possibilities for three 8s. Suppose instead of y=10, could y be another number?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, the sum would be 8+8+8+y+26=50 + y=60 ⇒ y=10. So, y must be 10. Therefore, in this case, the fourth element is fixed at 10. Therefore, when three 8s are present, the second largest number is fixed at 10. So, only one possibility here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if the three 8s are not the first three elements. Wait, but in a sorted list, the three 8s must be consecutive starting from the third position? No, if there are three 8s, since the median is the third element, which is 8, then the first two elements can be less than or equal to 8, and the last two can be greater than or equal to 8. However, to have three 8s, the three middle elements must be 8. For example, the list could be a,8,8,8,b. But in order for this to be sorted, a must be ≤8 and b must be ≥8. However, if a <8, then the first element is a <8, the next three are 8, and the last is b. For example, a=7, then b=7 +18=25. Then, the sum would be 7 +8+8+8+25=56. But 56 is less than 60. Wait, but according to the sum equation, a +b +24=60 ⇒ a +b=36. Since b=a +18, then a + (a +18)=36 ⇒ 2a +18=36 ⇒ 2a=18 ⇒ a=9. But a=9 would mean the first element is 9, which is greater than 8, conflicting with the sorted order because the next three elements are 8. So, that's invalid. Therefore, the only possible way for three 8s is if a=8, leading to b=26, as above. Then, the fourth element is 10. So, that's the only configuration with three 8s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this case, the second largest element is 10. So, in the three 8s case, the second largest is fixed at 10. So, that gives one possible value for the second largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, going back to the two 8s case. Let's consider both possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The list is a,8,8,y,b where a <8, y >8, and b =a +18. Also, sum is a +8 +8 +y +b=60 ⇒ a + y + b=44. Since b =a +18, then a + y + (a +18)=44 ⇒ 2a + y +18=44 ⇒ 2a + y=26. So, y=26 -2a. Since y must be an integer greater than 8 and less than or equal to b (which is a +18). So, 8 < y ≤a +18. But y=26 -2a. Therefore, 8 <26 -2a ≤a +18. Let's solve these inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "First inequality: 26 -2a >8 ⇒ -2a > -18 ⇒ a <9. Since a is a positive integer less than 8 (from the list structure), this is already satisfied because a <8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second inequality: 26 -2a ≤a +18 ⇒26 -18 ≤a +2a ⇒8 ≤3a ⇒a ≥8/3 ≈2.666. Since a is a positive integer, a ≥3.\n",

    "For each a, y=26 -2a, and b=a +18.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tabulate these:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a=3: y=26 -6=20; b=3 +18=21. Wait, but y=20 must be ≤b=21. Yes, 20 ≤21. So, the list would be [3,8,8,20,21]. Check sum:3+8+8+20+21=60. Yes. Range:21 -3=18. Mode is 8 (twice), others are unique. Median is 8. So, this works. The second largest element is 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a=4: y=26 -8=18; b=4 +18=22. List: [4,8,8,18,22]. Sum:4+8+8+18+22=60. Range:22-4=18. Mode 8, median 8. Second largest is18.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a=5: y=26 -10=16; b=5 +18=23. List: [5,8,8,16,23]. Sum:5+8+8+16+23=60. Range:23-5=18. Second largest is16.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, in this first case (two 8s with a,8,8,y,b), the second largest element (y) takes values 20,18,16,14,12. So, five different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the second case for two 8s: a, x,8,8,b where a <x <8, and b =a +18. The sum is a +x +8 +8 +b=60 ⇒a +x +b=44. Since b=a +18, substitute: a +x +a +18=44 ⇒2a +x +18=44 ⇒2a +x=26. So, x=26 -2a.\n",

    "First inequality: a <26 -2a ⇒3a <26 ⇒a <26/3≈8.666. Since a is at least 1, but in this case, since x <8, and a <x, then a must be less than x <8, so a <8. But let's use the second inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "26 -2a <8 ⇒-2a < -18 ⇒a >9. But a must be an integer. Wait, a >9, but we already have a <8.666 from the first inequality. Contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, that can't be. There must be an error here.\n",

    "Wait, let's go back. The second case is a, x,8,8,b where a ≤x <8, and b =a +18. Then, sum is a +x +8 +8 +b=60 ⇒a +x +b=44. Since b=a +18, then substituting, a +x +a +18=44 ⇒2a +x=26. So, x=26 -2a. Now, since x must be ≥a (because the list is sorted), so 26 -2a ≥a ⇒26 ≥3a ⇒a ≤26/3≈8.666. But since x <8, x=26 -2a <8 ⇒26 -2a <8 ⇒-2a < -18 ⇒a >9. But a must be an integer, so a ≥10. However, in the sorted list, a ≤x <8. If a ≥10, then x would be ≥a ≥10, but x <8, which is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case. Hence, the second case for two 8s is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when there are two 8s, only the first case is possible, where the list is a,8,8,y,b with a=3,4,5,6,7 and y=20,18,16,14,12 respectively.

    "So, in the two 8s case, the second largest element can be 12,14,16,18,20. So, five different values. Then, in the three 8s case, the second largest element is 10. So, that's one more value. Therefore, total possible values for the second largest element are 10,12,14,16,18,20. That's six different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but let's confirm if there are any other cases. For example, if 8 appears four times. Let's check that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 3: 8 appears four times. Then, the list would be a,8,8,8,8 or 8,8,8,8,b. However, since the range is 18, if four 8s are present, then either a or b is 8. If a=8, then b=8 +18=26. The list would be [8,8,8,8,26]. Sum is 8*4 +26=32 +26=58, which is less than 60. Not valid. Alternatively, if the list is [a,8,8,8,8], then b=8, so a=8 -18= -10. Not possible since numbers are positive. Therefore, four 8s is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, five 8s would have range 0, which contradicts the range of 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, only two cases: two 8s and three 8s.\n",

    "In two 8s case, second largest numbers are 12,14,16,18,20. In three 8s case, second largest is 10. So, total possible values are 10,12,14,16,18,20. That's six values.\n",

    "Wait, but let's check if the three 8s case is the only one with three 8s. Suppose another configuration with three 8s. For example, maybe a=8, x=8, y=8, but then b=26. But in the previous case, that's already covered. The list [8,8,8,10,26] is the only possible three 8s configuration. So, yes, the second largest is 10. So, 10 is an additional value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, combining both cases, the possible second largest elements are 10,12,14,16,18,20. So, six different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but let me verify again. In the two 8s case, when a=3, the list is [3,8,8,20,21], so the second largest is 20. When a=4, it's 18. a=5:16, a=6:14, a=7:12. So, those are 12,14,16,18,20. Then, three 8s case adds 10. So, total six.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, let me check if there's another configuration with three 8s. Suppose we have three 8s but with different arrangement. For example, a list like [8,8,8, y, b], but in this case, the first element is 8, so a=8, then b=8 +18=26, sum is 8+8+8+y+26=50 + y=60 ⇒ y=10. So, same as before. So, only one configuration here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if the three 8s are not consecutive? Wait, in a sorted list, if there are three 8s, they have to be consecutive in the middle. Because the list is sorted, so if you have three 8s, they would be positions 2,3,4 or 3,4,5. But since the median (position 3) is 8, if you have three 8s, they have to be positions 3,4,5 or 2,3,4. But if they are positions 2,3,4, then the first element is a ≤8 and the fifth element is b ≥8. However, if positions 3,4,5 are 8, then the first two elements are ≤8, and the fifth element is 8, which would make b=8, leading to range a=8 -18=-10, which is invalid. Therefore, the only valid way is having three 8s at positions 1,2,3, but that would require a=8, and then the list is [8,8,8,y,b], but we already saw that this leads to a sum issue unless y=10 and b=26.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, only one configuration here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in total, the second largest element can be 10,12,14,16,18,20. So, six different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, let me confirm if in the three 8s case, the second largest is 10, which is in the list [8,8,8,10,26], so the elements are 8,8,8,10,26. So, sorted, yes, the second largest is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the two 8s case, for a=7, the list is [7,8,8,12,25], so sorted, the second largest is 12. For a=6: [6,8,8,14,24], second largest 14. a=5:16, a=4:18, a=3:20. So, 12,14,16,18,20. Then, adding 10 from the three 8s case. So total six.\n",
    "\n",
    "But hold on, is 10 included? Let me see. The three 8s case gives us 10 as the second largest. Then the two 8s case gives us 12,14,16,18,20. So, total six different values. So, the answer should be 6. Therefore, the number of different values possible for the second largest element is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but let me check once more if there are any other possibilities. For example, in the two 8s case, when a=3, y=20, b=21. So, the second largest is 20, and the largest is 21. If instead, y is less than b, but in that case, since y=20 and b=21, the second largest is 20. Similarly, in all cases, y is exactly 26 -2a, and b is a +18. Since 26 -2a = y, and a +18 = b. So, y = b - (a +18) + (26 -2a). Wait, no, substitution shows that y =26 -2a, and b =a +18. Therefore, the difference between b and y is (a +18) - (26 -2a)=3a -8. For a=3: 3*3 -8=1 ⇒ y=20, b=21 ⇒ difference 1. For a=4:3*4 -8=4 ⇒ y=18, b=22 ⇒ difference 4. So, y and b are different numbers, so in all cases, the second largest is y, which is unique for each a.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, let's recall the properties given:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The only integer that occurs more than once is 8. That means 8 must appear at least twice, and all other numbers in the list must be unique. So, in the list of five numbers, two of them are 8, and the other three are distinct numbers different from each other and from 8.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. The average (mean) is 10. The sum of all five numbers must be 5 * 10 = 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find the largest possible integer that could be in the list. That would be the fifth number when the list is sorted. Let me try to structure this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the five numbers in ascending order as: a, b, c, d, e.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the median is 9, so c = 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 8 is the only number that repeats, and it must appear at least twice. But in the list a, b, c, d, e, we already have c=9. So the two 8s must be among a, b, and possibly one more. But wait, since the list is sorted, if there are two 8s, they need to be in the first two positions or one in the first and one in the second, but since the median is 9, the third position is fixed at 9. Let me think.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two 8s, then they have to be in the first two positions, because once we sort the list, the third is 9. So if 8 is in the list twice, then a = 8 and b = 8. Then c=9, and d and e are distinct numbers greater than or equal to 9, but since all numbers except 8 are unique, d and e must be greater than 9 and different from each other. Also, a and b are both 8, so the two duplicates are accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, hold on. The problem says \"the only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8\". So, all other numbers must occur exactly once. That means, in the list, there are two 8s, and the other three numbers must each be unique and different from 8. So, when sorted, the list could be [8, 8, 9, d, e], where d and e are distinct integers greater than 9 (since the median is 9, so the third term is 9, so the fourth and fifth must be at least 9, but since they come after 9 in the sorted list, they must be greater than or equal to 9. However, 8 is already used, and all other numbers must be unique. So d and e must be unique numbers greater than or equal to 9, but not equal to 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but 9 is already in the list once (as the median). So if d or e is 9, then 9 would occur twice, which violates the condition that only 8 occurs more than once. Therefore, d and e must be greater than 9, and also distinct from each other and from 8 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the list must be [8, 8, 9, d, e] where d and e are integers greater than 9, d ≠ e, d ≠ 8, d ≠9, e ≠8, e≠9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the sum of all five numbers is 50. So, 8 + 8 + 9 + d + e = 50. Let's compute that: 8 + 8 is 16, plus 9 is 25. So 25 + d + e = 50. Therefore, d + e = 25.\n",

    "If d is 10, then e would be 25 - 10 = 15. But we need to ensure that all numbers are distinct and meet the conditions. Let's check:\n",
    "\n",
    "List would be [8, 8, 9, 10, 15]. All numbers except 8 are unique. 8 occurs twice, others once. That's okay. The median is 9, the average is (8+8+9+10+15)/5 = 50/5 =10. So that works. So e can be 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, maybe we can make e larger by making d even smaller? But d has to be greater than 9, right? Because in the sorted list, after the median 9, the next number d must be at least 10. Wait, the numbers after the median must be greater than or equal to the median. Since the median is 9, d and e can be 9 or higher. But in our case, since 9 is already used once, and we can't have duplicates except for 8, d and e must be at least 10. Because if d were 9, then we would have two 9s, which is not allowed. So d must be at least 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the minimal possible d is 10, which would make e 15. However, maybe there's another way to arrange the numbers? Let me think again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, perhaps the two 8s are not both in the first two positions. For example, maybe one 8 is in the first position, and the other 8 is somewhere else? But since the list is sorted, if there are two 8s, they have to be adjacent in the sorted list. Wait, no. Let me see.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the list is sorted, then duplicates must be adjacent. So if there are two 8s, they must be in consecutive positions. However, the median is 9, which is the third number. Therefore, the third number is 9, so the two 8s can't be after the third position. So the two 8s must be in the first two positions, right? Because otherwise, if one 8 is in the first position, and the other is in the second, that's okay. But if one 8 is in the first position and the other is in the third position, that would mean 8 is the median, but the median is 9, so that's impossible. So the two 8s have to be in positions 1 and 2. Therefore, the list is [8, 8, 9, d, e].\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, d and e must be at least 10 and distinct. So the minimal d is 10, which gives e =15. But wait, maybe we can have a higher e if d is 11, then e would be 14. But then e is 14, which is less than 15. So to maximize e, we need to minimize d. Therefore, the minimal d is 10, leading to e=15.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but let me check another possibility. What if the two 8s are not in the first two positions? Wait, but the list is sorted, so if there's an 8 in the third position, that would make the median 8, which contradicts the given median of 9. Similarly, if an 8 is in the fourth or fifth position, that would mean there's an 8 after 9 in the sorted list, which would require the first two positions to be less than or equal to 8, but since we need two 8s, they would have to be in positions 1 and 2. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sorted list of five numbers: a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the median c is 9, so a and b are ≤9, and d and e are ≥9.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we have two 8s. Since 8 is less than 9, the two 8s must be in the first two positions, because otherwise, if one 8 is in a position after the median, that would mean that number is ≥9, but 8 is less than 9, which is impossible. Therefore, the two 8s must be a and b. Therefore, the list is [8, 8, 9, d, e], with d and e ≥9, distinct, different from 8 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, d and e must be integers greater than or equal to 10, distinct from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the sum of the list is 8 + 8 + 9 + d + e = 25 + d + e =50, so d + e=25.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize e, set d as small as possible. The smallest possible d is 10, which gives e=15. Then check if all numbers are distinct: 8,8,9,10,15. Yes, duplicates only at 8, others unique. This works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but let me check another possibility. If d is 11, then e=14. Then the list is [8,8,9,11,14]. The sum is still 50. But e=14 is smaller than 15, so 15 is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "If d is 12, e=13. e=13 is even smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, 15 seems the maximum possible. But let's check if d=10 is allowed. Since d must be at least 10, and 10 is allowed. Then e=15. So, is there any problem with that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, all numbers must be positive integers. 15 is a positive integer. So that works.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, let me check if there's another arrangement where the two 8s are not both in the first two positions. For example, maybe one 8 is in the first position, and another 8 is in the fourth position. But wait, in a sorted list, that's impossible. If the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, then all duplicates must be grouped together. So if there's an 8 in the fourth position, then all previous positions must be ≤8. But since we have two 8s, the first two positions would have to be 8, making the third position 9, then the fourth and fifth positions would have to be ≥9. But 8 is less than 9, so you can't have an 8 after 9 in the sorted list. Therefore, the two 8s must be before the median. Therefore, they have to be in positions 1 and 2. So the list is necessarily [8,8,9,d,e].\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, that structure is fixed. So the maximum possible e is 15. But let me check another thing. Suppose we have different numbers in a and b. Wait, but the problem says the only integer that occurs more than once is 8. So if a and b are both 8, that's okay. If, for example, a was 7 and b was 8, then we could have another 8 somewhere else. Wait, but no, because if a is 7 and b is 8, then the other 8 would have to be in position c, d, or e. But c is 9, so can't be 8. d and e are ≥9, so can't be 8. Therefore, the only way to have two 8s is if both a and b are 8. Otherwise, we can't have two 8s. So that structure is indeed fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the list must be [8,8,9,d,e] with d ≥10, e ≥d+1, and d + e =25. So the minimal d is 10, leading to e=15. Let me confirm this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum: 8+8+9+10+15=50. Check. Median is 9. Check. Only duplicates are the two 8s. Check. All other numbers are distinct. Check. The largest number is 15. So that seems to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but wait a second. Is 10 the minimal possible d? What if d is 9? Then e would be 16. But d is supposed to be after the median, which is 9, so d has to be at least 9. However, if d is 9, then we would have two 9s in the list (the median and d). But the problem states that the only integer that occurs more than once is 8. So we can't have two 9s. Therefore, d cannot be 9. So the minimal d is 10. So e=15 is the maximum possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let me check if there is another way to structure the list. For example, if instead of having two 8s at the start, perhaps one 8 is at the start and another 8 is somewhere else? But as I thought earlier, in a sorted list, that's impossible. Let me think again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the list is [8, x, 9, y, z], where x is another 8. Then x has to be ≤9 (since it's the second element), so x=8. Then y and z are ≥9. Then the list would be [8,8,9,y,z], same as before. Alternatively, if the two 8s are not consecutive, but in a sorted list, duplicates have to be consecutive. So the two 8s have to be the first two elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe the two 8s are not both at the beginning. For example, could we have [x, 8, 9, 8, z]? But that's not sorted. If we sort it, it becomes [x,8,8,9,z] which would make the median 8, contradicting the given median of 9. Therefore, that's impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the two 8s must be the first two elements, and the rest are sorted in non-decreasing order. So the structure is fixed as [8,8,9,d,e].\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, d and e have to be two distinct integers greater than 9, summing to 25. To maximize e, minimize d. The minimal d is 10, giving e=15. If we choose d=11, then e=14; d=12, e=13, etc. So 15 is the maximum possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let me check if there's a way to have a larger e by having the two 8s not in the first two positions. Wait, but as established earlier, that's impossible because of the sorted order and the median being 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe if some numbers before the median are lower, allowing for a higher number at the end. Wait, but if the two 8s are in the first two positions, the third is 9, then d and e are after that. If we lower a or b, but they can't be lower than 8 because we need two 8s. Wait, no. Wait, a and b are both 8. So we can't make them smaller. So a and b are fixed at 8. Therefore, the first three numbers are 8,8,9. Then d and e have to be at least 10, sum to 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, unless there's another number that can be placed in the d or e position which is smaller than 10, but that's not possible because the numbers after the median must be greater than or equal to the median. Since the median is 9, d and e must be at least 9. But 9 is already used once, and duplicates are not allowed except for 8. So d and e must be at least 10 and unique. Therefore, the minimal d is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, unless we can have one of them as 9, but that would duplicate the median, which is not allowed. So, no. So d and e must be at least 10. Therefore, d=10, e=15 is the only way to maximize e.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let me check another angle. Suppose we have a different structure where one of the 8s is not in the first two positions. For example, could we have [x,8,9,8,e], but then when sorted, this would become [x,8,8,9,e], which would make the median 8, which contradicts the given median of 9. Therefore, impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if we have two 8s after the median. For example, [x, y,9,8,8]. But when sorted, this would be [x, y,8,8,9], which is not possible because 8 is less than 9, so the sorted list would have the two 8s before the 9. Hence, the median would be 8, which again contradicts the given median of 9. Therefore, the two 8s must be before the median. Therefore, in the sorted list, the first two elements are 8, the third is 9, then the other two are 10 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the structure is fixed. Therefore, the maximum e is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just to make sure, let's verify again. If we set d=10, then e=15. The list is [8,8,9,10,15]. Sum is 8+8+9+10+15=50. Mean is 10. Median is 9. Only duplicates are the two 8s. All other numbers are unique. So this satisfies all conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a way to have a larger e? Let's see. If we could decrease the sum of the other numbers, we could increase e. But the sum of the first three numbers is fixed at 8+8+9=25, so the sum of d and e must be 25. To maximize e, we need to minimize d. Since d must be at least 10, the minimal d is 10, leading to e=15.\n",

    "Wait, unless we can have d=9, but that would make two 9s, which is not allowed. So no. Therefore, 15 is indeed the maximum possible.\n",
