The problem is about finding the number of quadruples (P, Q, R, k) where P, Q, R are positive digits (so 1 through 9) and k is a positive integer with k \\u2264 2018. The condition given is that P in 2k digits minus Q in k digits equals R in k digits squared. Then we need to find N, the number of such quadruples, and then compute the sum of the digits of N.\\n\\nFirst, let's understand what the notation means. For a digit D and integer k, D_{(k)} is a number with k digits all equal to D. For example, 3_{(4)} is 3333. So, P_{(2k)} is a number with 2k digits all P, Q_{(k)} is a number with k digits all Q, and R_{(k)} is a number with k digits all R. The equation given is:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nOur goal is to find all quadruples (P, Q, R, k) that satisfy this equation, with the constraints on P, Q, R being digits (1-9) and k \\u2264 2018.\\n\\nFirst, let's express these numbers numerically. Let's write expressions for each term.\\n\\nFor a digit D and number of digits m, D_{(m)} can be written as D \\u00d7 (10^{m} - 1)/9. For example, 3_{(4)} = 3 \\u00d7 (10\\u2074 - 1)/9 = 3 \\u00d7 1111 = 3333. So:\\n\\n- P_{(2k)} = P \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1)/9\\n- Q_{(k)} = Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9\\n- R_{(k)} = R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9\\n\\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\\n\\nP \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1)/9 - Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9 = [R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9]\\u00b2\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators:\\n\\nP \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1) - Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1) = [R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)]\\u00b2 / 9\\n\\nWait, actually, if we multiply both sides by 9, the left side becomes:\\n\\n9 \\u00d7 [P \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1)/9 - Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9] = P \\u00d7 (10^{2k} - 1) - Q \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)\\n\\nAnd the right side becomes:\\n\\n9 \\u00d7 [R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)/9]\\u00b2 = [R \\u00d7 (10^{k} - 1)]\\u00b2 / 9\\n\\nWait, actually, squaring [R*(10^k -1)/9] would give [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/81, then multiplying by 9 gives [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9. So:\\n\\nLeft side: P*(10^{2k} -1) - Q*(10^k -1)\\nRight side: [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9\\n\\nSo the equation is:\\n\\nP*(10^{2k} -1) - Q*(10^k -1) = [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9\\n\\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor or rearrange terms. Let's see.\\n\\nFirst, note that 10^{2k} -1 factors as (10^k -1)(10^k +1). So:\\n\\nLeft side: P*(10^k -1)(10^k +1) - Q*(10^k -1) = (10^k -1)[P*(10^k +1) - Q]\\n\\nSo, left side is (10^k -1)[P*(10^k +1) - Q]\\n\\nRight side is [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9\\n\\nSo, setting them equal:\\n\\n(10^k -1)[P*(10^k +1) - Q] = [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2]/9\\n\\nWe can divide both sides by (10^k -1), assuming 10^k -1 \\u2260 0, which it isn't since k is a positive integer. So:\\n\\nP*(10^k +1) - Q = [R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)]/9\\n\\nNow, let's rearrange this equation:\\n\\n9[P*(10^k +1) - Q] = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9P*(10^k +1) - 9Q = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)\\n\\nLet me write this as:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P + R\\u00b2) - 9Q = 0\\n\\nWait, let's expand the left side:\\n\\n9P*(10^k +1) = 9P*10^k + 9P\\n\\nThen subtract 9Q: 9P*10^k + 9P - 9Q\\n\\nSet equal to R\\u00b2*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*10^k - R\\u00b2\\n\\nTherefore, moving everything to left side:\\n\\n9P*10^k + 9P - 9Q - R\\u00b2*10^k + R\\u00b2 = 0\\n\\nFactor terms with 10^k:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P - 9Q + R\\u00b2) = 0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P - 9Q + R\\u00b2) = 0\\n\\nLet me denote:\\n\\nA = 9P - R\\u00b2\\n\\nB = 9P - 9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nSo the equation becomes:\\n\\nA*10^k + B = 0\\n\\nWhich gives:\\n\\nA*10^k = -B\\n\\nBut 10^k is positive, so for this equation to hold, A and B must have opposite signs, but since 10^k is a large positive number (k is positive integer), unless A and B are both zero? Wait, but if A and B are both zero, then equation holds for all k. Wait, but in our case, since A and B depend on P, Q, R, which are digits, maybe there are solutions where A and B are zero? Let's check.\\n\\nIf A = 0 and B = 0, then:\\n\\n9P - R\\u00b2 = 0\\n\\nand\\n\\n9P - 9Q + R\\u00b2 = 0\\n\\nFrom the first equation: R\\u00b2 = 9P. Since R is a digit (1-9), R\\u00b2 can be 1,4,9,16,...,81. But R is a digit, so R\\u00b2 must be a perfect square from 1 to 81. Since 9P must equal R\\u00b2, and P is a digit (1-9), so 9P ranges from 9 to 81. So R\\u00b2 must be a multiple of 9 between 9 and 81, hence R\\u00b2 can be 9, 36, 81. So:\\n\\nIf R\\u00b2 = 9, then 9P = 9 \\u21d2 P =1\\n\\nIf R\\u00b2 = 36, then 9P = 36 \\u21d2 P =4\\n\\nIf R\\u00b2 = 81, then 9P =81 \\u21d2 P=9\\n\\nSo possible (P, R) pairs are (1,3), (4,6), (9,9). Then, from the second equation:\\n\\n9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 = 0 \\u21d2 9P -9Q +9P =0 (since R\\u00b2=9P from first equation)\\n\\nWait, wait, the second equation is 9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 = 0. But since R\\u00b2 =9P, substituting:\\n\\n9P -9Q +9P =0 \\u21d2 18P -9Q =0 \\u21d2 2P = Q\\n\\nSo Q = 2P.\\n\\nBut P is a digit (1-9), and Q must be a digit (1-9). So let's check for each possible (P, R):\\n\\nCase 1: P=1, R=3. Then Q=2*1=2. Q=2 is valid.\\n\\nCase 2: P=4, R=6. Then Q=2*4=8. Q=8 is valid.\\n\\nCase 3: P=9, R=9. Then Q=2*9=18. But Q must be a digit (1-9). 18 is invalid. So this case is invalid.\\n\\nTherefore, when A=0 and B=0, we have two possible quadruples: (P, Q, R, k) = (1,2,3,k) and (4,8,6,k), for any k. Since k is a positive integer with k \\u22642018, each of these quadruples would contribute 2018 possibilities (since k can be any from 1 to 2018). However, the problem states \\\"quadruples (P, Q, R, k)\\\" with P, Q, R positive digits and k \\u22642018. So each of these (P, Q, R) pairs (1,2,3) and (4,8,6) would be paired with all k from 1 to 2018, hence 2018 quadruples each. So that's 2*2018 =4036 quadruples.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem says \\\"quadruples (P, Q, R, k)\\\", so if these two (P, Q, R) combinations work for any k, then indeed each k gives a distinct quadruple. So if A=0 and B=0, then the equation holds for any k. Therefore, these two (P, Q, R) combinations are valid for all k from 1 to 2018, hence 2018 each. So 2*2018=4036 quadruples from this case.\\n\\nNow, besides the case where A=0 and B=0, are there other solutions where A and B are non-zero but satisfy A*10^k + B=0? Let's see.\\n\\nFrom the equation A*10^k + B =0, we have:\\n\\nA*10^k = -B\\n\\nSince A and B are integers (as P, Q, R are digits and coefficients are integers), and 10^k is positive. Therefore, A must be negative and B must be positive, or vice versa. But let's see:\\n\\nA =9P - R\\u00b2\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nIf A is negative, then 9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 >9P\\n\\nIf B is positive, then 9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 >9Q -9P\\n\\nAlternatively, if A is positive and B is negative, but then 10^k is positive, so A*10^k + B=0 would require B = -A*10^k, which is negative. But if A is positive, then B must be negative.\\n\\nBut given that P, Q, R are digits (1-9), let's see possible values for A and B.\\n\\nCompute possible A and B.\\n\\nA =9P - R\\u00b2. Since P is 1-9, 9P ranges 9-81. R is 1-9, R\\u00b2 ranges 1-81. So A can be from 9*1 -81= -72 to 9*9 -1=80.\\n\\nSimilarly, B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2. Since 9P -9Q can be from 9*1 -9*9= -72 to 9*9 -9*1=72. Then adding R\\u00b2 (1-81), so B can be from -72 +1= -71 to 72 +81=153.\\n\\nBut given that A and B must satisfy A*10^k + B =0, so A*10^k = -B. Therefore, A and B must have opposite signs. Let's consider two cases:\\n\\nCase 1: A positive, B negative. Then A*10^k = -B. Since A is positive, B is negative. Then:\\n\\nA*10^k = |B|\\n\\nSo |B| must be divisible by A, and |B| = A*10^k. But since B is 9P -9Q + R\\u00b2, which is an integer between -71 and 153, and A is 9P - R\\u00b2, which is between -72 and 80. But given A is positive here, so 9P - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 <9P.\\n\\nSimilarly, since |B| = A*10^k, and |B| is at most 153 (since B is between -71 and 153, but here B is negative, so |B| is up to 71). But A is positive integer (since A =9P - R\\u00b2 >0). So A*10^k = |B|.\\n\\nBut 10^k is at least 10 (since k is at least 1). But |B| is at most 71 in this case. So A*10^k \\u226471. But A is at least 1 (since 9P - R\\u00b2 is positive integer). So 1*10^k \\u226471 \\u21d2 10^k \\u226471. Since k is a positive integer, k can be 1 or 2 (10^1=10, 10^2=100). 10^2=100 which is already greater than 71. So k can only be 1 here. Then:\\n\\nA*10^1 \\u226471 \\u21d2 10A \\u226471 \\u21d2 A \\u22647.1, so A \\u22647. Since A is positive integer, A=1,2,...,7.\\n\\nThus, possible A=1 to7. For each A, |B| =10*A. But |B| is at most 71, so 10*A \\u226471 \\u21d2 A \\u22647.1, which is satisfied. So:\\n\\nFor A=1, |B|=10 \\u21d2 B=-10\\n\\nFor A=2, |B|=20 \\u21d2 B=-20\\n\\n...\\n\\nFor A=7, |B|=70 \\u21d2 B=-70\\n\\nBut B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2. So for each A from 1 to7, we have:\\n\\nFrom A=9P - R\\u00b2 and B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2= -10, -20,..., -70\\n\\nBut since A=9P - R\\u00b2 and B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2, let's substitute R\\u00b2 =9P - A into B:\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + (9P -A)= 18P -9Q -A\\n\\nSet this equal to -10A (since |B|=10A and B is negative, so B= -10A):\\n\\nWait, actually, from above, |B| = A*10^k. But in this case, k=1, so |B|=10A. So B= -10A. Therefore:\\n\\n18P -9Q -A = -10A\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n18P -9Q = -9A\\n\\nDivide both sides by 9:\\n\\n2P - Q = -A\\n\\nBut A=9P - R\\u00b2. Therefore:\\n\\n2P - Q = - (9P - R\\u00b2)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n2P - Q = -9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nBring all terms to left side:\\n\\n11P - Q - R\\u00b2 =0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n11P - Q = R\\u00b2\\n\\nGiven that P, Q, R are digits (1-9), let's analyze this equation: 11P - Q = R\\u00b2.\\n\\nSince Q is a digit from 1-9, 11P - Q ranges from 11*1 -9=2 to 11*9 -1=98. But R\\u00b2 is a square from 1 to81. Therefore, possible R\\u00b2 can be 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81.\\n\\nSo 11P - Q must be one of these squares. Let's consider possible R\\u00b2 values and solve for P and Q.\\n\\nFor each R from 1 to9, R\\u00b2 is as above. Then 11P - Q = R\\u00b2.\\n\\nBut since Q is between 1 and9, 11P must be between R\\u00b2 +1 and R\\u00b2 +9. Therefore:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 +1 \\u226411P \\u2264 R\\u00b2 +9\\n\\nThus, 11P must be in the interval [R\\u00b2 +1, R\\u00b2 +9]. So:\\n\\n(R\\u00b2 +1)/11 \\u2264 P \\u2264 (R\\u00b2 +9)/11\\n\\nBut P must be an integer between1 and9. Let's compute for each R:\\n\\nCase 1: R=1, R\\u00b2=1\\n\\nThen 11P \\u2208 [2,10]\\n\\nSo P must be 1, since 11*1=11 is not in [2,10]. Wait, 11P must be between 2 and10, but 11P is at least11. So no solution here.\\n\\nWait, this is a contradiction. So for R=1, R\\u00b2=1, 11P - Q=1. Then Q=11P -1. Since Q must be between1-9, 11P -1 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226410 \\u21d2P \\u22640.9, which is impossible. So R=1: no solution.\\n\\nSimilarly, R=2, R\\u00b2=4\\n\\n11P - Q=4 \\u21d2 Q=11P -4\\n\\nQ must be 1-9, so 11P -4 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226413 \\u21d2P \\u22641.18 \\u21d2 P=1\\n\\nThen Q=11*1 -4=7. So (P,Q,R)=(1,7,2). Check if 11P - Q=11 -7=4=2\\u00b2. Yes. So this is a valid solution.\\n\\nCheck if this satisfies A=9P - R\\u00b2=9*1 -4=5, and B= -10A= -50.\\n\\nBut let's check if this works in the original equation. Let's see.\\n\\nGiven (P, Q, R, k)=(1,7,2,1). Let's check if P_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)}= (R_{(k)})\\u00b2.\\n\\nHere k=1. So:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=11, Q_{(1)}=7, R_{(1)}=2. Then:\\n\\n11 -7=4, and 2\\u00b2=4. So yes, it works. So this is a valid solution. So (1,7,2,1) is a quadruple. Since k=1 here.\\n\\nBut earlier, in this case, we're considering k=1 because for A positive and B negative, the only possible k is1. So this quadruple is part of this case.\\n\\nContinuing with R=2, found one solution: (1,7,2).\\n\\nR=3, R\\u00b2=9\\n\\n11P - Q=9 \\u21d2 Q=11P -9\\n\\nQ must be 1-9, so 11P -9 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226418 \\u21d2P \\u22641.63 \\u21d2 P=1.\\n\\nThen Q=11*1 -9=2. So (P,Q,R)=(1,2,3). Check 11*1 -2=9=3\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSo this is another solution: (1,2,3). Now check with the equations.\\n\\nA=9P - R\\u00b2=9*1 -9=0. Wait, A=0? But in this case, we were considering A positive and B negative, but here A=0. However, earlier, when A=0, we have the case where A=0 and B=0, which we considered before, leading to quadruples (1,2,3,k) for all k. But here, in the current case where A positive and B negative, we found a solution (1,2,3) which actually belongs to the previous case where A=0. Therefore, perhaps this is overlapping with the previous case.\\n\\nWait, if R=3, then R\\u00b2=9. Then A=9P - R\\u00b2=9*1 -9=0. So A=0. Then B=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=9*1 -9*2 +9=9 -18 +9=0. Therefore, this is part of the case where A=0 and B=0, which is valid for all k. So perhaps when we considered R=3, even though in this step we found (1,2,3), this is already counted in the previous case where A=0 and B=0. So in the current case (A positive, B negative), perhaps we should not have considered R=3, because it leads to A=0, which is a different case. Therefore, maybe the solution (1,2,3) is already accounted for in the A=0 and B=0 case, and we need to avoid double-counting.\\n\\nBut in our previous analysis for R=3, we found that (1,2,3) is part of the A=0 and B=0 case, which works for all k. So in this current case (A positive, B negative), when we set R=3, we end up with A=0, which is invalid here. So perhaps the solution (1,2,3) is not part of this case. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in including it here. Let's verify.\\n\\nWait, when we started this case (A positive, B negative), we considered A=9P - R\\u00b2 >0. However, for R=3, we have A=0. Therefore, R=3 is excluded from this case. So perhaps when solving R=3, we get A=0, which is not part of this case. Therefore, maybe there was an error in the analysis.\\n\\nWait, let's step back. When we considered the case where A positive and B negative, we had equations leading to 11P - Q = R\\u00b2. For R=3, R\\u00b2=9, so 11P - Q=9. Solving for Q=11P -9. For P=1, Q=2. Then A=9*1 -9=0, which is not positive, so this solution is invalid in this case (A positive). Therefore, even though algebraically solving 11P - Q = R\\u00b2 gives a solution, when we check A, we find it's zero, so this solution is invalid in this case and belongs to the previous A=0 case.\\n\\nTherefore, in the current case (A positive, B negative), R=3 is invalid because it leads to A=0. So for R=3, no solution in this case. Therefore, the solution (1,2,3) is part of the A=0 case.\\n\\nContinuing:\\n\\nR=4, R\\u00b2=16\\n\\n11P - Q=16 \\u21d2 Q=11P -16\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -16 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226517 \\u21d2P\\u22651.54\\u21d2 P=2 or higher\\n\\nAlso, 11P -16 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226425 \\u21d2P\\u22642.27\\u21d2 P=2\\n\\nSo P=2. Q=11*2 -16=22 -16=6. So (P,Q,R)=(2,6,4). Check 11*2 -6=22 -6=16=4\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSo this is a valid solution: (2,6,4). Now check A and B.\\n\\nA=9P - R\\u00b2=9*2 -16=18 -16=2\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=18 -54 +16= -20\\n\\nSo A=2, B=-20. Then equation A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d22*10^k -20=0 \\u21d22*10^k=20 \\u21d210^k=10 \\u21d2k=1. So k=1 is valid.\\n\\nTherefore, quadruple (2,6,4,1) is a solution.\\n\\nCheck in original equation:\\n\\nP_{(2k)}=2_{(2)}=22\\n\\nQ_{(k)}=6_{(1)}=6\\n\\nR_{(k)}=4_{(1)}=4\\n\\n22 -6=16=4\\u00b2. Correct. So this works.\\n\\nContinuing:\\n\\nR=5, R\\u00b2=25\\n\\n11P - Q=25 \\u21d2Q=11P -25\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -25 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226526 \\u21d2P\\u22652.36\\u21d2 P=3,4,...,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -25 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226434 \\u21d2P\\u22643.09\\u21d2 P=3\\n\\nSo P=3. Q=11*3 -25=33 -25=8. So (3,8,5). Check 11*3 -8=33 -8=25=5\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*3 -25=27 -25=2\\n\\nB=9*3 -9*8 +25=27 -72 +25= -20\\n\\nSo A=2, B=-20. Then equation A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d22*10^k=20 \\u21d2k=1.\\n\\nTherefore, quadruple (3,8,5,1). Check original equation:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=33, Q_{(1)}=8, R_{(1)}=5. 33 -8=25=5\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nR=6, R\\u00b2=36\\n\\n11P - Q=36 \\u21d2Q=11P -36\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -36 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226537 \\u21d2P\\u22653.36\\u21d2 P=4,5,...,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -36 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226445 \\u21d2P\\u22644.09\\u21d2 P=4\\n\\nSo P=4. Q=11*4 -36=44 -36=8. So (4,8,6). Check 11*4 -8=44 -8=36=6\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*4 -36=36 -36=0. Again, A=0. So this is part of the A=0 case. So this solution (4,8,6) is part of the A=0 and B=0 case, which works for all k. Therefore, in the current case (A positive, B negative), this is invalid, as A=0.\\n\\nR=7, R\\u00b2=49\\n\\n11P - Q=49 \\u21d2Q=11P -49\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -49 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226550 \\u21d2P\\u22654.54\\u21d2 P=5,6,...,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -49 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226458 \\u21d2P\\u22645.27\\u21d2 P=5\\n\\nSo P=5. Q=11*5 -49=55 -49=6. So (5,6,7). Check 11*5 -6=55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*5 -49=45 -49=-4\\n\\nBut we are in the case where A is positive. So here A=-4, which is invalid. Therefore, this solution is invalid in this case. So even though algebraically we found (5,6,7), when computing A, it's negative, so this is part of a different case.\\n\\nBut wait, in this case, we set up the equation with A positive and B negative. So if A is negative here, this is not part of this case. Therefore, this solution (5,6,7) must be part of the other case where A negative and B positive. Let's see.\\n\\nR=7, R\\u00b2=49:\\n\\nA=9P - R\\u00b2=45 -49=-4\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=45 -54 +49=40\\n\\nSo equation: A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d2 -4*10^k +40=0 \\u21d2 -4*10^k = -40 \\u21d210^k=10\\u21d2k=1. So k=1.\\n\\nSo here, A is negative, B is positive. So this belongs to the other case. So we'll get to this later.\\n\\nContinuing with R=7, since in our current case (A positive, B negative), this solution is invalid. So R=7 doesn't give a solution here.\\n\\nR=8, R\\u00b2=64\\n\\n11P - Q=64 \\u21d2Q=11P -64\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -64 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226565 \\u21d2P\\u22655.9\\u21d2 P=6,7,8,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -64 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226473 \\u21d2P\\u22646.63\\u21d2 P=6\\n\\nSo P=6. Q=11*6 -64=66 -64=2. So (6,2,8). Check 11*6 -2=66 -2=64=8\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*6 -64=54 -64=-10\\n\\nB=9*6 -9*2 +64=54 -18 +64=100\\n\\nEquation: A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d2-10*10^k +100=0 \\u21d2-10^{k+1} +100=0 \\u21d210^{k+1}=100\\u21d2k+1=2\\u21d2k=1.\\n\\nSo k=1. So quadruple (6,2,8,1). Check:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=66, Q_{(1)}=2, R_{(1)}=8. 66 -2=64=8\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nBut here, A=-10 which is negative, B=100 positive. So this belongs to the other case (A negative, B positive). Therefore, not part of the current case.\\n\\nR=9, R\\u00b2=81\\n\\n11P - Q=81 \\u21d2Q=11P -81\\n\\nQ must be 1-9 \\u21d211P -81 \\u22651 \\u21d211P \\u226582 \\u21d2P\\u22657.45\\u21d2 P=8,9\\n\\nAlso, 11P -81 \\u22649 \\u21d211P \\u226490 \\u21d2P\\u22648.18\\u21d2 P=8\\n\\nSo P=8. Q=11*8 -81=88 -81=7. So (8,7,9). Check 11*8 -7=88 -7=81=9\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nCheck A and B:\\n\\nA=9*8 -81=72 -81=-9\\n\\nB=9*8 -9*7 +81=72 -63 +81=90\\n\\nEquation: A*10^k + B=0 \\u21d2-9*10^k +90=0 \\u21d2-9*10^k = -90 \\u21d210^k=10 \\u21d2k=1.\\n\\nThus, quadruple (8,7,9,1). Check:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=88, Q_{(1)}=7, R_{(1)}=9. 88 -7=81=9\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nBut again, A is negative here, so this is part of the other case.\\n\\nSo summarizing Case 1 (A positive, B negative), we found the following solutions:\\n\\n- R=2: (P,Q,R)=(1,7,2) with k=1\\n\\n- R=4: (2,6,4) with k=1\\n\\n- R=5: (3,8,5) with k=1\\n\\nBut wait, when R=5, we had (3,8,5) with A=2 and B=-20, so A=2 positive, B=-20 negative. So that is part of this case. Similarly, R=2 and R=4 give valid solutions here. However, R=3 and R=6 lead to A=0, which are part of the earlier case. So in total, in Case 1 (A positive, B negative), we have three solutions: (1,7,2,1), (2,6,4,1), (3,8,5,1). Each with k=1.\\n\\nNow let's consider Case 2: A negative and B positive.\\n\\nSo A=9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 >9P\\n\\nB=9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 >0\\n\\nFrom the equation A*10^k + B =0 \\u21d2 A*10^k = -B. Since A is negative and B is positive, this equation is possible. Let's write:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k = - (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2)\\n\\nLet me rearrange this:\\n\\n( R\\u00b2 -9P )*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nLet me denote C = R\\u00b2 -9P (which is positive since A=9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d2 C= -A >0)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nC*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nBut R\\u00b2 = C +9P. Substitute into the equation:\\n\\nC*10^k =9P -9Q + C +9P\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nC*10^k =18P -9Q + C\\n\\nSubtract C from both sides:\\n\\nC*(10^k -1) =18P -9Q\\n\\nDivide both sides by9:\\n\\nC*(10^k -1)/9 =2P - Q\\n\\nLet me denote D = C*(10^k -1)/9. Then:\\n\\n2P - Q = D\\n\\nBut Q is a digit from1-9, so 2P - D = Q. Since Q \\u22651, 2P - D \\u22651. Also, Q \\u22649 \\u21d22P - D \\u22649 \\u21d2 D \\u22652P -9\\n\\nBut D is equal to C*(10^k -1)/9, where C=R\\u00b2 -9P (positive integer). Let's analyze.\\n\\nGiven that C = R\\u00b2 -9P >0, so R\\u00b2 >9P.\\n\\nAlso, D = [C*(10^k -1)]/9.\\n\\nSince 10^k -1 is divisible by9 (since 10^k \\u22611 mod9, so 10^k -1 \\u22610 mod9), so (10^k -1)/9 is an integer. For example, (10^1 -1)/9=1, (10^2 -1)/9=11, etc. Let me denote S_k = (10^k -1)/9, which is an integer with k digits all 1's. For example, S_1=1, S_2=11, S_3=111, etc.\\n\\nTherefore, D= C * S_k\\n\\nSo 2P - Q = C * S_k\\n\\nBut Q=2P - C * S_k\\n\\nSince Q must be a digit (1-9), we have:\\n\\n1 \\u22642P - C * S_k \\u22649\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n2P -9 \\u2264C * S_k \\u22642P -1\\n\\nBut C = R\\u00b2 -9P >0, so substituting:\\n\\n2P -9 \\u2264(R\\u00b2 -9P)*S_k \\u22642P -1\\n\\nThis seems complicated. Let's see if we can find possible values for k.\\n\\nGiven that S_k is 1,11,111,..., up to k=2018. However, since C is at least1 (since R\\u00b2 -9P \\u22651, because R\\u00b2 >9P and R and P are integers), and S_k grows exponentially with k. However, the left side 2P -9 is at least 2*1 -9= -7 and at most 2*9 -9=9. The right side 2P -1 is at least1 (for P=1:2*1 -1=1) and at most17 (for P=9:2*9 -1=17). But C * S_k is a positive integer (since C>0 and S_k>0). Therefore:\\n\\nLeft inequality: 2P -9 \\u2264C * S_k\\n\\nBut since C * S_k \\u22651*1=1, and 2P -9 can be negative. So the real constraints come from:\\n\\nC * S_k \\u22642P -1\\n\\nBut since C = R\\u00b2 -9P and R is at most9, R\\u00b2 is at most81. So C = R\\u00b2 -9P \\u226481 -9*1=72. So C \\u226472. But S_k = (10^k -1)/9. For k=1, S_1=1; k=2, S_2=11; k=3,111, etc.\\n\\nBut the right inequality C * S_k \\u22642P -1. Let's consider possible values of k.\\n\\nIf k=1, S_1=1. So:\\n\\nC*1 \\u22642P -1 \\u21d2C \\u22642P -1. But C=R\\u00b2 -9P, so:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 -9P \\u22642P -1 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226411P -1\\n\\nGiven that R\\u00b2 >9P (from C>0), so 9P < R\\u00b2 \\u226411P -1\\n\\nSo R must satisfy:\\n\\nFor each P, possible R such that 9P < R\\u00b2 \\u226411P -1\\n\\nSince R is a digit (1-9), R\\u00b2 can be up to81. Let's check for each P from1 to9:\\n\\nP=1:\\n\\n9*1=9 < R\\u00b2 \\u226411*1 -1=10. So R\\u00b2 must be between9 and10. The only integer R\\u00b2 in this range is9, but R\\u00b2>9. So no solution.\\n\\nP=2:\\n\\n9*2=18 < R\\u00b2 \\u226422 -1=21. So R\\u00b2 must be 19,20,21. But R\\u00b2 must be a square. No squares in 19-21.\\n\\nP=3:\\n\\n27 < R\\u00b2 \\u226433 -1=32. R\\u00b2=25, but 25<27. Next square is36>32. No solution.\\n\\nP=4:\\n\\n36 < R\\u00b2 \\u226444 -1=43. R\\u00b2=36 is not greater than36. Next square is49>43. No solution.\\n\\nP=5:\\n\\n45 < R\\u00b2 \\u226455 -1=54. R\\u00b2=49<45? No, 49>45. Wait, 45 < R\\u00b2 \\u226454. So R\\u00b2=49, but 49 is in the range (45,54]. So R=7. Check if R\\u00b2=49.\\n\\nSo P=5, R=7. Then C=R\\u00b2 -9P=49 -45=4\\n\\nThen Q=2P - C*S_k=10 -4*1=6. So (5,6,7). Check if 11P - Q=55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nWait, but this solution (5,6,7) we found earlier in the A negative case. So for k=1, we can have this solution.\\n\\nBut let's verify the original equation. For (5,6,7,1):\\n\\nP_{(2)}=55, Q_{(1)}=6, R_{(1)}=7. 55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, check if there are other solutions for k=1.\\n\\nP=6:\\n\\n54 < R\\u00b2 \\u226466 -1=65. R\\u00b2=64 (since 64 is in (54,65]). R=8. C=64 -54=10. Q=12 -10*1=2. So (6,2,8). Check 11*6 -2=66 -2=64=8\\u00b2. Correct. So (6,2,8,1) is another solution.\\n\\nP=7:\\n\\n63 < R\\u00b2 \\u226477 -1=76. R\\u00b2=64,81. 64<63? No. 81>76. No solution.\\n\\nP=8:\\n\\n72 < R\\u00b2 \\u226488 -1=87. R\\u00b2=81. R=9. C=81 -72=9. Q=16 -9*1=7. So (8,7,9). Check 11*8 -7=88 -7=81=9\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nP=9:\\n\\n81 < R\\u00b2 \\u226499 -1=98. R\\u00b2=81 is not greater than81. Next square is100>98. No solution.\\n\\nTherefore, for k=1, we have solutions:\\n\\n(5,6,7,1), (6,2,8,1), (8,7,9,1)\\n\\nThese are the same solutions we found earlier when considering R=5,7,8,9 in the previous case. So for k=1, in Case2 (A negative, B positive), we have three solutions.\\n\\nNow, check for k=2.\\n\\nFor k=2, S_2=11.\\n\\nSo equation:\\n\\nC *11 =2P - Q\\n\\nBut C=R\\u00b2 -9P>0.\\n\\nSo Q=2P -11C\\n\\nSince Q must be a digit (1-9):\\n\\n1 \\u22642P -11C \\u22649\\n\\nBut C\\u22651, so:\\n\\n2P -11*1 \\u22651 \\u21d22P \\u226512 \\u21d2P\\u22656\\n\\nAlso,\\n\\n2P -11C \\u22649 \\u21d211C \\u22652P -9\\n\\nBut since C=R\\u00b2 -9P, and C\\u22651, so R\\u00b2 -9P \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u22659P +1.\\n\\nBut P\\u22656, so R\\u00b2 \\u22659*6 +1=55. R is a digit up to9, so R\\u00b2=64,81.\\n\\nLet's check for P=6:\\n\\nC=R\\u00b2 -54 \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226555. Possible R\\u00b2=64,81. So R=8,9.\\n\\nFor R=8:\\n\\nC=64 -54=10\\n\\nQ=2*6 -11*10=12 -110= -98. Invalid, since Q must be positive.\\n\\nFor R=9:\\n\\nC=81 -54=27\\n\\nQ=12 -11*27=12 -297= -285. Invalid.\\n\\nNo solutions for P=6.\\n\\nP=7:\\n\\nC=R\\u00b2 -63 \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226564. R=8,9.\\n\\nR=8: C=64 -63=1\\n\\nQ=14 -11*1=3. Valid. Check if Q=3.\\n\\nCheck equation 11P - Q=11*7 -3=77 -3=74. Which should equal R\\u00b2=64. But 74\\u226064. Wait, conflict here.\\n\\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's check.\\n\\nWait, if P=7, R=8, then C= R\\u00b2 -9P=64 -63=1. Then Q=2P -11C=14 -11=3. Then the original equation 11P - Q=77 -3=74. But R\\u00b2=64. 74\\u226064. So this is invalid. Therefore, even though algebraically we found Q=3, it doesn't satisfy the original equation. Hence, this is a false solution.\\n\\nWait, why is this happening? Because in our approach, we derived equations assuming certain conditions, but we might have missed some constraints.\\n\\nWait, let's recall that in this case, we started with:\\n\\n( R\\u00b2 -9P )*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nBut when we substitute k=2, P=7, R=8, Q=3:\\n\\nLeft side: (64 -63)*100=1*100=100\\n\\nRight side:9*7 -9*3 +64=63 -27 +64=100\\n\\nSo 100=100. So equation holds.\\n\\nBut according to the original equation:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)}=(R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nHere, k=2. So:\\n\\nP_{(4)}=7777\\n\\nQ_{(2)}=33\\n\\nR_{(2)}=88\\n\\nCheck:\\n\\n7777 -33=7744\\n\\n88\\u00b2=7744. Correct.\\n\\nBut according to digits, Q=3 is valid, R=8 is valid. So this quadruple (7,3,8,2) is valid. Wait, but according to our earlier notation, (P,Q,R,k)=(7,3,8,2). But in our calculation, we had Q=3. So where is the discrepancy?\\n\\nWait, when we solved Q=2P -11C=14 -11=3, which gives Q=3. So (P,Q,R,k)=(7,3,8,2). But when we check the original equation, it works. So why did we get confused earlier?\\n\\nBecause when we checked 11P - Q=77 -3=74\\u226064=R\\u00b2. But this seems contradictory. Wait, but in this case, the equation we solved was not 11P - Q=R\\u00b2, but rather a different equation. Wait, no. Let's recall how we arrived here.\\n\\nIn the case where A is negative (A=9P - R\\u00b2 <0) and B positive, we derived that:\\n\\n( R\\u00b2 -9P )*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2\\n\\nWhich, for k=2, P=7, R=8, Q=3, gives:\\n\\n(64 -63)*100=63 -27 +64 \\u21d21*100=100=100, which is true.\\n\\nBut the equation 11P - Q=R\\u00b2 was derived in the previous case (A positive, B negative), which doesn't apply here. Therefore, in this case, we don't have 11P - Q=R\\u00b2. Instead, we have a different relationship. Therefore, the solution (7,3,8,2) is valid, even though 11P - Q \\u2260 R\\u00b2.\\n\\nWait, this is a critical point. In the case where A is negative and B is positive, the relationship between P, Q, R, k is different from the previous case. So in this case, the equation ( R\\u00b2 -9P )*10^k =9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 is the key equation, not 11P - Q=R\\u00b2. Therefore, the solution (7,3,8,2) is valid even though 11*7 -3=74\\u226064=8\\u00b2. Because that equation was specific to the other case.\\n\\nTherefore, our earlier confusion was unfounded. The solution (7,3,8,2) is valid. So, let's continue.\\n\\nSo for P=7, R=8, C=1:\\n\\nQ=2*7 -11*1=14 -11=3. Valid. So quadruple (7,3,8,2). Check:\\n\\nP_{(4)}=7777, Q_{(2)}=33, R_{(2)}=88\\n\\n7777 -33=7744. 88\\u00b2=7744. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, for R=9, P=7:\\n\\nC=81 -63=18\\n\\nQ=14 -11*18=14 -198= -184. Invalid.\\n\\nSo only R=8 gives a valid solution for P=7, k=2.\\n\\nNext, P=8:\\n\\nC=R\\u00b2 -72 \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226573. R=9 (R\\u00b2=81)\\n\\nC=81 -72=9\\n\\nQ=2*8 -11*9=16 -99= -83. Invalid.\\n\\nP=9:\\n\\nC=R\\u00b2 -81 \\u22651 \\u21d2R\\u00b2 \\u226582. But R is at most9, R\\u00b2=81. So no solution.\\n\\nTherefore, for k=2, we have one solution: (7,3,8,2)\\n\\nSimilarly, check for k=3.\\n\\nFor k=3, S_3=111.\\n\\nEquation:\\n\\nC *111=2P -Q \\u21d2Q=2P -111C\\n\\nQ must be 1-9:\\n\\n1 \\u22642P -111C \\u22649\\n\\nSince C\\u22651 and integer, 111C \\u2265111. So 2P -111C \\u22651 \\u21d22P \\u2265111C +1 \\u2265112 \\u21d2P\\u226556. But P is a digit (1-9). Impossible. Therefore, no solutions for k\\u22653.\\n\\nSimilarly, for k\\u22653, S_k is too large, making Q=2P - S_k*C negative or exceeding 9. Therefore, only k=1 and k=2 may have solutions in this case.\\n\\nBut wait, for k=2, we had one solution: (7,3,8,2). Let's check if there are solutions for k=2 and other P values.\\n\\nWait, we already checked P=6 to9 for k=2. For P=7, we found one solution. P=8,9: no solution. Let's check P=5:\\n\\nBut earlier, for k=2, we considered P\\u22656. Because C=R\\u00b2 -9P \\u22651. So R\\u00b2 \\u22659P +1. For P=5:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 \\u226546. Possible R=7 (49),8 (64),9(81). Let's try.\\n\\nFor P=5, R=7:\\n\\nC=49 -45=4\\n\\nQ=2*5 -11*4=10 -44= -34. Invalid.\\n\\nR=8:\\n\\nC=64 -45=19\\n\\nQ=10 -11*19=10 -209= -199. Invalid.\\n\\nR=9:\\n\\nC=81 -45=36\\n\\nQ=10 -11*36=10 -396= -386. Invalid.\\n\\nNo solutions.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=4:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 \\u226537. R=7,8,9.\\n\\nC= R\\u00b2 -36.\\n\\nFor R=7:\\n\\nC=49 -36=13\\n\\nQ=8 -11*13=8 -143= -135. Invalid.\\n\\nSimilarly, no solutions.\\n\\nTherefore, only solution for k=2 is (7,3,8,2).\\n\\nSimilarly, check for k=2, P=7, R=8. We already did that.\\n\\nTherefore, in Case2 (A negative, B positive), we have solutions:\\n\\nFor k=1:\\n\\n- (5,6,7,1)\\n\\n- (6,2,8,1)\\n\\n- (8,7,9,1)\\n\\nFor k=2:\\n\\n- (7,3,8,2)\\n\\nTotal of4 solutions from Case2.\\n\\nAdditionally, in Case1 (A positive, B negative), we had three solutions:\\n\\n- (1,7,2,1)\\n\\n- (2,6,4,1)\\n\\n- (3,8,5,1)\\n\\nAnd in the A=0 and B=0 case, two solutions valid for all k:\\n\\n- (1,2,3,k) for k=1 to2018\\n\\n- (4,8,6,k) for k=1 to2018\\n\\nTherefore, total N is:\\n\\n- From A=0, B=0: 2*2018=4036\\n\\n- From Case1 (A>0,B<0):3*1=3\\n\\n- From Case2 (A<0,B>0):4*1=4\\n\\nBut wait, in Case2, for k=2, we have one solution, but in k=1, three solutions, totaling four solutions. So total N=4036 +3 +4=4043.\\n\\nBut wait, need to check if there are more solutions for k=2 in Case2.\\n\\nWait, for k=2, we only found one solution: (7,3,8,2). For other P and R?\\n\\nWait, perhaps check P=4, k=2.\\n\\nWait, but earlier steps showed that for k=2, only P=7 gives a valid solution. So total solutions in Case2 are:\\n\\nk=1:3 solutions\\n\\nk=2:1 solution\\n\\nTotal:4\\n\\nTherefore, N=4036 +3 +4=4043.\\n\\nBut let's verify each solution:\\n\\nFrom A=0 and B=0:\\n\\n- (1,2,3,k) for k=1 to2018:2018 quadruples\\n\\n- (4,8,6,k) for k=1 to2018:2018 quadruples\\n\\nTotal:4036\\n\\nFrom Case1 (A>0,B<0):\\n\\n- (1,7,2,1)\\n\\n- (2,6,4,1)\\n\\n- (3,8,5,1)\\n\\nTotal:3\\n\\nFrom Case2 (A<0,B>0):\\n\\n- (5,6,7,1)\\n\\n- (6,2,8,1)\\n\\n- (8,7,9,1)\\n\\n- (7,3,8,2)\\n\\nTotal:4\\n\\nWait, but earlier in Case2 (A<0,B>0), we had:\\n\\nFor k=1: (5,6,7,1), (6,2,8,1), (8,7,9,1)\\n\\nFor k=2: (7,3,8,2)\\n\\nTotal 4.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo total N=4036 +3 +4=4043.\\n\\nBut let's verify the solution (5,6,7,1):\\n\\nP=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1\\n\\nCheck:\\n\\n5_{(2)}=55, 6_{(1)}=6, 7_{(1)}=7\\n\\n55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, (6,2,8,1):\\n\\n6_{(2)}=66,2_{(1)}=2,8_{(1)}=8\\n\\n66 -2=64=8\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\n(8,7,9,1):\\n\\n8_{(2)}=88,7_{(1)}=7,9_{(1)}=9\\n\\n88 -7=81=9\\u00b2.

Correct.\\n\\nSo all these solutions are valid.\\n\\nThus, total N=4036 +3 +4=4043.\\n\\nBut let's check if there are any other solutions in Case2 for k=2. For example, if P=7, R=8, k=2 gives one solution. What about P= other values?\\n\\nFor k=2, we saw that only P=7 gives a solution. For example, if P=8, R=9, then C=81 -72=9, Q=2*8 -11*9=16 -99=-83 invalid.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=9, no solution.\\n\\nTherefore, only one solution for k=2.\\n\\nThus, N=4043.\\n\\nNow, compute the sum of the digits of N=4043.\\n\\nDigits:4,0,4,3.

The problem is about finding the number of quadruples (P, Q, R, k) where P, Q, R are positive digits (so 1 through 9) and k is a positive integer with k \\u2264 2018. The condition given is that P_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2. Then, we need to find the sum of the digits of N, where N is the number of such quadruples.\\n\\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the notation correctly. The symbol D_{(k)} represents a number with k digits, all equal to D. For example, 3_{(4)} is 3333. So, P_{(2k)} is a number with 2k digits, all P's. Similarly, Q_{(k)} is a number with k digits, all Q's, and R_{(k)} is a number with k digits, all R's. The equation given is:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nSo, we need to find all quadruples (P, Q, R, k) satisfying this equation with the constraints on P, Q, R (they are digits from 1 to 9) and k \\u2264 2018.\\n\\nLet me start by expressing each term in the equation numerically. Let's denote:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} = P * (10^{2k - 1} + 10^{2k - 2} + ... + 10^0) = P * ( (10^{2k} - 1)/9 )\\n\\nSimilarly, Q_{(k)} = Q * ( (10^{k} - 1)/9 )\\n\\nAnd R_{(k)} = R * ( (10^{k} - 1)/9 )\\n\\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\\n\\nP * ( (10^{2k} - 1)/9 ) - Q * ( (10^{k} - 1)/9 ) = [ R * ( (10^{k} - 1)/9 ) ]\\u00b2\\n\\nLet me simplify this equation step by step. First, multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators:\\n\\nP * (10^{2k} - 1) - Q * (10^{k} - 1) = [ R * (10^{k} - 1) ]\\u00b2 / 81\\n\\nWait, actually, let's check that again. The original equation:\\n\\nLeft side: P_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = [R_{(k)}]^2\\n\\nExpressed in terms of numbers:\\n\\nLeft side: P*( (10^{2k} - 1)/9 ) - Q*( (10^{k} - 1)/9 )\\n\\nRight side: [ R*( (10^{k} - 1)/9 ) ]\\u00b2\\n\\nSo, if we multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators on the left:\\n\\nLeft side becomes: P*(10^{2k} - 1) - Q*(10^{k} - 1)\\n\\nRight side becomes: [ R*(10^{k} - 1) ]\\u00b2 / 9\\n\\nWait, because the right side was [ R*( (10^k -1)/9 ) ]\\u00b2, so expanding that:\\n\\n= R\\u00b2 * (10^k -1)^2 / 81\\n\\nTherefore, multiplying both sides by 9 gives:\\n\\nLeft side: P*(10^{2k} -1) - Q*(10^k -1)\\n\\nRight side: R\\u00b2 * (10^k -1)^2 / 9\\n\\nHmm, maybe instead of multiplying by 9, let's rearrange the equation:\\n\\nLet me write the equation again:\\n\\nP*( (10^{2k} -1)/9 ) - Q*( (10^k -1)/9 ) = [ R*( (10^k -1)/9 ) ]\\u00b2\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 81 to eliminate all denominators:\\n\\n9P*(10^{2k} -1) - 9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9P*(10^{2k} -1) - 9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nLet me factor the left side. Note that 10^{2k} -1 factors as (10^k -1)(10^k +1). So:\\n\\n9P*(10^k -1)(10^k +1) - 9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nFactor out (10^k -1) on the left:\\n\\n(10^k -1)[9P*(10^k +1) -9Q] = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nDivide both sides by (10^k -1), assuming 10^k -1 \\u2260 0, which it isn't since k is a positive integer:\\n\\n9P*(10^k +1) -9Q = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)\\n\\nLet me write this as:\\n\\n9P*10^k + 9P -9Q = R\\u00b2*10^k - R\\u00b2\\n\\nBring all terms to one side:\\n\\n9P*10^k +9P -9Q - R\\u00b2*10^k + R\\u00b2 = 0\\n\\nFactor terms with 10^k:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2) = 0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k + (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2) = 0\\n\\nLet me rearrange this equation:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k = - (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2)\\n\\nNote that the left side is (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k and the right side is - (9P -9Q + R\\u00b2). Let's denote:\\n\\nLeft side: (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k\\n\\nRight side: -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k = -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2\\n\\nLet me write this equation as:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k +9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 =0\\n\\nBut perhaps another approach would be better. Let's consider that 10^k is a very large number compared to the other terms when k is large. Since k can be up to 2018, 10^k is enormous. Therefore, the term (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k must be balanced by the term -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2. However, since 10^k is so large, unless (9P - R\\u00b2) is zero, the left side would be either extremely large positive or negative, which can't be balanced by the other terms. Therefore, likely (9P - R\\u00b2) must be zero. Let me check that.\\n\\nSuppose 9P - R\\u00b2 = 0. Then:\\n\\nR\\u00b2 =9P\\n\\nTherefore, R\\u00b2 must be divisible by 9, so R must be 3, 6, or 9, since R is a digit from 1 to 9. Then:\\n\\nIf R=3, then 9P =9*1 => P=1\\n\\nIf R=6, then 9P=36 => P=4\\n\\nIf R=9, then 9P=81 => P=9\\n\\nTherefore, possible (R, P) pairs are (3,1), (6,4), (9,9).\\n\\nIf 9P - R\\u00b2 =0, then the equation reduces to:\\n\\n0 +9P -9Q + R\\u00b2 =0\\n\\nBut since R\\u00b2=9P, substitute:\\n\\n9P -9Q +9P =0 => 18P -9Q=0 => 2P = Q\\n\\nSo Q=2P\\n\\nSince Q must be a positive digit (1-9), and P is also a digit (1-9), so possible values for P are such that 2P \\u22649. Therefore:\\n\\nIf P=1, Q=2\\n\\nP=2, Q=4\\n\\nP=3, Q=6\\n\\nP=4, Q=8\\n\\nP=5, Q=10 which is invalid since Q must be a digit (1-9). Similarly for P=6, Q=12 invalid, etc. So only P=1,2,3,4 with Q=2,4,6,8 respectively.\\n\\nBut earlier, we had R\\u00b2=9P, so R is determined by P. Let's tabulate the possible quadruples (P, Q, R, k):\\n\\nFor each valid P (1,2,3,4), Q=2P, R such that R\\u00b2=9P. Let's see:\\n\\nCase 1: P=1, Q=2, R\\u00b2=9*1=9 \\u21d2 R=3. So quadruple (1,2,3,k). But since 9P - R\\u00b2=0, the equation holds for any k? Wait, hold on. If 9P - R\\u00b2=0, then the original equation reduces to 0 +9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=0, which we already satisfied by Q=2P. Therefore, if 9P - R\\u00b2=0, then the equation holds for any k? Wait, let's check.\\n\\nWait, when we set 9P - R\\u00b2=0, then the equation becomes:\\n\\n(0)*10^k +9P -9Q + R\\u00b2=0\\n\\nBut since R\\u00b2=9P, this becomes 0 +9P -9Q +9P=0 \\u21d2 18P -9Q=0 \\u21d2 Q=2P, which is already satisfied. Therefore, for these values of P, Q, R, the equation holds for any k. Therefore, for each such quadruple (P, Q, R), all k from 1 to 2018 would satisfy the equation. Therefore, the number of quadruples in this case is 4 (since P=1,2,3,4) each with k from 1 to 2018. So 4*2018.\\n\\nBut wait, R must be a positive digit. For R=3,6,9, which are all valid digits. So for P=1, R=3; P=2, R=6? Wait, wait. Wait R\\u00b2=9P. So:\\n\\nWait, if R\\u00b2=9P, then for P=1, R\\u00b2=9*1=9 \\u21d2 R=3\\n\\nFor P=2, R\\u00b2=18, which is not a perfect square. Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on. Wait, I thought R\\u00b2=9P. So:\\n\\nWait, when 9P - R\\u00b2=0, then R\\u00b2=9P. Therefore, R must be a multiple of 3, since R\\u00b2 is divisible by 9. So R=3,6,9. Then:\\n\\nIf R=3, R\\u00b2=9=9*1 \\u21d2 P=1\\n\\nIf R=6, R\\u00b2=36=9*4 \\u21d2 P=4\\n\\nIf R=9, R\\u00b2=81=9*9 \\u21d2 P=9\\n\\nTherefore, only P=1,4,9 are possible here. Wait, this contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, let's recast:\\n\\nIf R\\u00b2=9P, then since R is a digit (1-9), R can be 3,6,9 because their squares are 9,36,81, which must equal 9P. Therefore:\\n\\nFor R=3: 9=9P \\u21d2 P=1\\n\\nFor R=6: 36=9P \\u21d2 P=4\\n\\nFor R=9: 81=9P \\u21d2 P=9\\n\\nTherefore, only P=1,4,9 are possible here, with corresponding R=3,6,9. Then Q=2P must be an integer digit. So:\\n\\nFor P=1: Q=2*1=2 (valid)\\n\\nFor P=4: Q=2*4=8 (valid)\\n\\nFor P=9: Q=2*9=18 (invalid, since Q must be a digit from 1-9)\\n\\nTherefore, only P=1 and P=4 are valid here. So the possible quadruples are:\\n\\n(P=1, Q=2, R=3, k) for any k \\u22642018\\n\\n(P=4, Q=8, R=6, k) for any k \\u22642018\\n\\nSo that's two quadruples for each k. Therefore, for each k from 1 to 2018, there are two quadruples. So total N from this case is 2*2018.\\n\\nWait, but wait, when P=9, Q=18 is invalid, so that's not allowed. So only two possible (P, Q, R) combinations where 9P - R\\u00b2=0, leading to valid digits. Therefore, each of these two (P, Q, R) combinations can be paired with any k from 1 to 2018, giving 2*2018 quadruples.\\n\\nBut let's check if this is indeed correct. Let's take an example. Let's take k=1.\\n\\nFor k=1:\\n\\nP=1, Q=2, R=3\\n\\nSo P_{(2k)} =11, Q_{(k)}=2, R_{(k)}=3\\n\\nSo 11 -2=9, which is 3\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, for k=1, P=4, Q=8, R=6:\\n\\nP_{(2)}=44, Q_{(1)}=8, R_{(1)}=6\\n\\n44 -8=36=6\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, for k=2:\\n\\nP=1, Q=2, R=3:\\n\\nP_{(4)}=1111, Q_{(2)}=22, R_{(2)}=33\\n\\n1111 -22=1089=33\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=4, Q=8, R=6:\\n\\nP_{(4)}=4444, Q_{(2)}=88, R_{(2)}=66\\n\\n4444 -88=4356=66\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nSo yes, these work for any k. Therefore, these two quadruples (with P=1, Q=2, R=3 and P=4, Q=8, R=6) work for all k from 1 to 2018, giving 2*2018=4036 quadruples.\\n\\nBut wait, earlier, when I considered R=9, P=9, Q=18, which is invalid. So only two possibilities here.\\n\\nBut now, the problem is, are there other solutions where 9P - R\\u00b2 \\u22600? Because the previous reasoning assumed that 9P - R\\u00b2 must be zero, otherwise the term (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k would be enormous, but maybe for small k, this term isn't that big? Let's check.\\n\\nSuppose 9P - R\\u00b2 \\u22600. Then the equation is:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k = -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2\\n\\nNote that the left side is (9P - R\\u00b2)*10^k, which is either a large positive or negative number, while the right side is -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2, which is a number between, say, -9*9 +9*9 -9*9 = -81 +81 -81 = -81, and 9*9 -9*1 -1*1=81 -9 -1=71. So the right side is between -81 and 81, approximately.\\n\\nBut 10^k grows exponentially. For k=1, 10^1=10; for k=2, 100; k=3, 1000; etc. So unless (9P - R\\u00b2)=0, the left side will be either very large positive or negative, which cannot equal the right side (which is at most 81 in absolute value). Therefore, for k \\u22651, unless 9P - R\\u00b2=0, there are no solutions. Therefore, the only solutions are those where 9P - R\\u00b2=0, and hence Q=2P, as we found earlier. Therefore, only the two quadruples (P=1, Q=2, R=3, k) and (P=4, Q=8, R=6, k) for each k from 1 to 2018. So total N=2*2018=4036.\\n\\nWait, but hold on. Let's check k=1. For k=1, we have:\\n\\nEquation: P_{(2)} - Q_{(1)} = (R_{(1)})\\u00b2\\n\\nWhich is 11P - Q = R\\u00b2\\n\\nBut in our previous analysis, we have two possibilities:\\n\\nCase 1: 9P - R\\u00b2=0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2=9P. So R=3, P=1; R=6, P=4; R=9, P=9 (invalid). Then Q=2P. So for k=1, let's see:\\n\\nFor P=1, Q=2, R=3: 11*1 -2=9=3\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nFor P=4, Q=8, R=6: 11*4 -8=44-8=36=6\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nBut wait, 11*P - Q= R\\u00b2. But according to the equation, when k=1:\\n\\nP_{(2k)}=P_{(2)}=11*P (if P is a digit, but actually, P_{(2)} is a two-digit number with both digits P. So for example, P=1, P_{(2)}=11; P=4, P_{(2)}=44. Similarly, Q_{(1)}=Q. And R_{(1)}=R. So the equation is:\\n\\nFor k=1, P_{(2)} - Q = R\\u00b2.\\n\\nSo for example, P=1: 11 - Q = R\\u00b2. Then, if R=3, 11 - Q=9 \\u21d2 Q=2. Which is valid.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=4: 44 - Q = R\\u00b2. If R=6, 44 - Q=36 \\u21d2 Q=8. Valid.\\n\\nBut wait, if we didn't have the constraint 9P - R\\u00b2=0, could there be other solutions? For example, suppose P=2. Then, 22 - Q = R\\u00b2. Q and R are digits. So R\\u00b2 must be 22 - Q. Since Q is from 1-9, R\\u00b2 is from 13 to 21. But 13,14,...,21 are not perfect squares. So no solution here.\\n\\nSimilarly, P=3: 33 - Q = R\\u00b2. R\\u00b2 must be 33 - Q, which is 24 to 32. No squares there.\\n\\nP=5: 55 - Q = R\\u00b2. 55 - Q ranges from 46 to 54. 49 is a square (7\\u00b2=49). So if Q=6, 55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. So R=7. Wait, but according to our previous analysis, this shouldn't be a solution. Because according to our earlier reasoning, solutions only exist when 9P - R\\u00b2=0, but here, 9*5 - 7\\u00b2=45 -49=-4\\u22600. So this seems to be a contradiction.\\n\\nWait, but hold on. If P=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1:\\n\\nCheck the equation: P_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nSo, for k=1: 55 -6=49=7\\u00b2. Correct. So this is a valid solution. But according to our previous reasoning, this shouldn't exist. Therefore, our earlier assumption that 9P - R\\u00b2 must be zero is incorrect. Therefore, there are solutions where 9P - R\\u00b2 \\u22600. Therefore, our previous reasoning was flawed.\\n\\nTherefore, we need to re-examine the problem.\\n\\nSo, let's start over. The equation is:\\n\\n9P*(10^{2k} -1) -9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Let me write the original equation again:\\n\\nP_{(2k)} - Q_{(k)} = (R_{(k)})\\u00b2\\n\\nExpressed numerically:\\n\\nP*(10^{2k} -1)/9 - Q*(10^k -1)/9 = [ R*(10^k -1)/9 ]\\u00b2\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 81:\\n\\n9P*(10^{2k} -1) -9Q*(10^k -1) = R\\u00b2*(10^k -1)^2\\n\\nLet me denote x = 10^k. Then, 10^{2k} = x\\u00b2. So the equation becomes:\\n\\n9P*(x\\u00b2 -1) -9Q*(x -1) = R\\u00b2*(x -1)^2\\n\\nFactor left side:\\n\\n9P*(x -1)(x +1) -9Q*(x -1) = R\\u00b2*(x -1)^2\\n\\nFactor out (x -1):\\n\\n(x -1)[9P(x +1) -9Q] = R\\u00b2*(x -1)^2\\n\\nAssuming x \\u22601 (which is true since x=10^k \\u226510), we can divide both sides by (x -1):\\n\\n9P(x +1) -9Q = R\\u00b2*(x -1)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9P(x +1) - R\\u00b2x + R\\u00b2 -9Q =0\\n\\nWait, perhaps rearrange terms:\\n\\n9P*x +9P - R\\u00b2*x + R\\u00b2 -9Q =0\\n\\nGroup terms with x:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x + (9P + R\\u00b2 -9Q)=0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x +9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2=0\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x = -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2\\n\\nNote that x=10^k, which is a positive integer power of 10. So x must be a positive integer, and in our case, k is a positive integer \\u22642018, so x=10^k is an integer from 10 to 10^{2018}.\\n\\nBut since x is huge for large k, the left side (9P - R\\u00b2)x is either very large positive or negative, while the right side is -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2, which is bounded because P, Q, R are digits (1-9). Let's see:\\n\\nThe right side:\\n\\n-9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2\\n\\nSince P and Q are digits from 1-9, 9(P - Q) can range from -72 (if P=1, Q=9) to 72 (if P=9, Q=1). Then, -9(P - Q) ranges from -72 to 72. Then subtract R\\u00b2, which is 1-81. So the entire right side ranges from -72 -81= -153 to 72 -1=71. So the right side is between -153 and 71.\\n\\nBut the left side is (9P - R\\u00b2)x, where x=10^k \\u226510. So (9P - R\\u00b2) multiplied by at least 10. Therefore, unless 9P - R\\u00b2=0, the left side will have absolute value \\u226510*|9P - R\\u00b2|. Since 9P - R\\u00b2 can be from 9*1 -1\\u00b2=8 to 9*9 -9\\u00b2=0. Wait, but R is a digit from 1-9, so R\\u00b2 can be from 1 to 81, and 9P is from 9 to 81. So 9P - R\\u00b2 can range from 9*1 -9=0 to 9*9 -1=80. So 9P - R\\u00b2 can be between 0 and 80.\\n\\nWait, but if 9P - R\\u00b2 is positive, then (9P - R\\u00b2)x is positive, but the right side is -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2, which can be positive or negative. However, if 9P - R\\u00b2 is positive, then the left side is positive, but the right side can be at most 71. So:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x = negative number - R\\u00b2. Wait, the right side is -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2. If P < Q, then -9(P - Q) is positive, so the right side is positive minus R\\u00b2. If P \\u2265 Q, then -9(P - Q) is negative or zero, so the right side is negative - R\\u00b2, which is negative.\\n\\nBut the left side is (9P - R\\u00b2)x, which is positive (since 9P - R\\u00b2 \\u22650 if P \\u2265 R\\u00b2/9. For example, if P=1, R\\u00b2 \\u22649; R=1,2,3. If P=2, R\\u00b2 \\u226418; R=1-4 (since 4\\u00b2=16 <18). Wait, but R is a digit up to 9. Wait, 9P - R\\u00b2 can be positive or negative.\\n\\nWait, actually, 9P - R\\u00b2 can range from:\\n\\nFor P=1: 9*1 - R\\u00b2. R can be 1-9. So 9 -1=8, 9-4=5, ..., 9-81= -72.\\n\\nSimilarly, for P=9: 81 - R\\u00b2. R can be 1-9. So 81-1=80, ..., 81-81=0.\\n\\nTherefore, 9P - R\\u00b2 can be both positive and negative. Therefore, the left side (9P - R\\u00b2)x can be positive or negative. However, x=10^k is positive, so the sign of the left side is the same as the sign of (9P - R\\u00b2).\\n\\nBut the right side is -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2. Let's analyze possible cases.\\n\\nCase 1: 9P - R\\u00b2 =0. Then, as before, the equation reduces to 0 = -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2. But since 9P - R\\u00b2=0, R\\u00b2=9P. Therefore:\\n\\n-9(P - Q) -9P =0 \\u21d2 -9P +9Q -9P=0 \\u21d2 -18P +9Q=0 \\u21d2 2P=Q. So Q=2P. As before.\\n\\nBut when 9P - R\\u00b2=0, we have solutions for any k, as the equation reduces to an identity. But we saw that for k=1, there are other solutions where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, like P=5, Q=6, R=7. So how does that fit in?\\n\\nWait, in that case, for k=1, x=10. Let's plug into the equation:\\n\\n(9P - R\\u00b2)x +9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2=0\\n\\nSo for P=5, Q=6, R=7, x=10:\\n\\n(45 -49)*10 +9*(5 -6) +49= (-4)*10 +9*(-1) +49= -40 -9 +49=0. Correct.\\n\\nSo even though 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, the equation holds. So how?\\n\\nBecause the term (9P - R\\u00b2)x is balanced by the other terms. So even for k=1, x=10, which is not extremely large, so the left side (9P - R\\u00b2)x is not negligible. But in this case, (9*5 -7\\u00b2)*10= (45 -49)*10= (-4)*10= -40, and the other terms 9*(5 -6) +49= -9 +49=40, so total -40 +40=0.\\n\\nSo in this case, the two parts cancel each other. Therefore, even for k=1, there can be solutions where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600. Therefore, our initial assumption that only solutions with 9P - R\\u00b2=0 exist is incorrect. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities: when 9P - R\\u00b2=0 and when it's not.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of quadruples is the sum of:\\n\\n1. The number of quadruples where 9P - R\\u00b2=0, which gives Q=2P, and valid P=1,4,9 (but Q must be a digit, so P=1,4 only). For each of these, k can be from 1 to 2018. So 2*2018.\\n\\n2. The number of quadruples where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, but the equation (9P - R\\u00b2)x +9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2=0 holds for some x=10^k, k \\u22642018. For these cases, x must be an integer (specifically, x=10^k), so we need to solve for x:\\n\\nx = [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 )\\n\\nBut x must be equal to 10^k for some integer k \\u22642018. Therefore, for each possible (P, Q, R) where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, we can compute x and check if it is a power of 10, and if so, check if k= log_10(x) is an integer \\u22642018.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem reduces to two parts:\\n\\n- Counting quadruples where 9P - R\\u00b2=0 (already found: 2*2018=4036)\\n\\n- Counting quadruples where 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600 but x= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 ) is a power of 10, i.e., x=10^k for some k \\u22642018.\\n\\nTherefore, we need to find all (P, Q, R) with P,Q,R digits, 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, and such that [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 ) =10^k for some k.\\n\\nTherefore, for each possible (P, Q, R), compute x= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 ) and check if x is a positive integer power of 10, and if so, check if k= log_10(x) is an integer \\u22642018. For each such valid (P, Q, R, k), we have a quadruple.\\n\\nSo, first, let's handle the first case: 9P - R\\u00b2=0. As established, this gives two quadruples for each k, so 2*2018=4036.\\n\\nNow, the second case: 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600. Let's analyze the equation:\\n\\nx= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 ) =10^k\\n\\nNote that x must be positive because x=10^k >0. Therefore, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign. So:\\n\\nEither:\\n\\n1. -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 >0 and 9P - R\\u00b2 >0\\n\\nOr\\n\\n2. -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 <0 and 9P - R\\u00b2 <0\\n\\nLet's analyze both possibilities.\\n\\nCase 1: Both numerator and denominator positive.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n-9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d2 -9P +9Q - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d29Q >9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nand\\n\\n9P - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d29P > R\\u00b2\\n\\nTherefore, in this case, we have 9P > R\\u00b2 and 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2. Since Q is a digit (1-9), 9Q \\u226481. So 9P + R\\u00b2 <81. But since 9P > R\\u00b2, let's see:\\n\\nFrom 9P > R\\u00b2, we have R\\u00b2 <9P. Therefore, substituting into the second inequality:\\n\\n9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 >9P + R\\u00b2 (since R\\u00b2 <9P) but wait, 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2, but R\\u00b2 <9P, so 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 >9P +0=9P. Therefore, 9Q >9P \\u21d2 Q >P.\\n\\nSo in this case, Q >P. Also, since 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 and R\\u00b2 <9P, we can write:\\n\\n9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 \\u21d2 Q >P + R\\u00b2/9\\n\\nBut R\\u00b2 <9P \\u21d2 R\\u00b2/9 <P. Therefore, Q >P + (something less than P). But since Q is at most 9, and P is at least 1, this might not give us much.\\n\\nBut let's consider that x=10^k must be an integer. So x= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ] / (9P - R\\u00b2 )\\n\\nBut in this case, numerator and denominator are positive. Let's denote:\\n\\nNumerator=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2\\n\\nDenominator=9P - R\\u00b2\\n\\nTherefore, x= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ]\\n\\nWe need this fraction to be equal to 10^k. Let's denote:\\n\\n[9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ] =10^k\\n\\nLet me rearrange this equation:\\n\\n9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 =10^k*(9P - R\\u00b2 )\\n\\nLet me write this as:\\n\\n9Q -9P - R\\u00b2 =9*10^k P -10^k R\\u00b2\\n\\nBring all terms to one side:\\n\\n9Q -9P - R\\u00b2 -9*10^k P +10^k R\\u00b2=0\\n\\nFactor terms with P and R\\u00b2:\\n\\nP*( -9 -9*10^k ) + R\\u00b2*( -1 +10^k ) +9Q=0\\n\\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, rearrange terms:\\n\\n9Q =9*10^k P -10^k R\\u00b2 +9P + R\\u00b2 - R\\u00b2\\n\\nWait, maybe not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, group terms with P and R\\u00b2:\\n\\n9Q =9P(10^k +1) - R\\u00b2(10^k -1)\\n\\nBut perhaps this is not helpful either.\\n\\nAlternatively, let's consider that x=10^k, which is a power of 10, so it's 1 followed by k zeros. Therefore, x=10^k= (10^k). So x is an integer with k+1 digits: a 1 followed by k zeros.\\n\\nBut the fraction [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ] must equal this. Therefore, unless the numerator is a multiple of the denominator, x won't be an integer. Therefore, we need:\\n\\n[9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] \\u22610 mod [9P - R\\u00b2 ]\\n\\nBut this seems tricky. Let's take the example we had earlier: P=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1.\\n\\nCheck if this fits into the equation:\\n\\nx= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ] = [9*(6 -5) -49 ]/[45 -49 ]= [9 -49]/[-4]= (-40)/(-4)=10=10^1. So x=10, which is 10^1. Therefore, k=1. So this works.\\n\\nTherefore, in this case, x=10^1, which is 10. So this is a valid solution.\\n\\nTherefore, to find all such solutions, we need to find all triples (P, Q, R) where P, Q, R are digits, 9P - R\\u00b2\\u22600, and [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] divided by [9P - R\\u00b2 ] equals 10^k for some integer k \\u22651, and k \\u22642018.\\n\\nTherefore, for each possible (P, Q, R), we can compute x= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] / [9P - R\\u00b2 ] and check if x is a positive power of 10 (i.e., x=10,100,1000,..., up to 10^{2018}).\\n\\nBut since P, Q, R are digits from 1 to 9, there are 9*9*9=729 possible triples (P, Q, R). However, many of them will not satisfy the conditions. Let's see if we can find a smarter way.\\n\\nFirst, note that x=10^k must be an integer, so [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ] must be divisible by [9P - R\\u00b2 ]. Let's denote:\\n\\nLet\\u2019s define numerator N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2\\n\\nDenominator D=9P - R\\u00b2\\n\\nTherefore, x= N/D=10^k\\n\\nTherefore, N= D*10^k\\n\\nTherefore, since D divides N, we have D divides N. So D divides N= D*10^k. Therefore, D divides N, which is trivially true. But since x=10^k, which is a power of 10, the prime factors of D must be only 2 and 5. However, D=9P - R\\u00b2. Let's see:\\n\\nD=9P - R\\u00b2. Since 9P and R\\u00b2 are both integers, D must be an integer. Also, since x=10^k>0, D and N must have the same sign. As we considered earlier, there are two cases: both positive or both negative.\\n\\nBut let's focus on the first case where D=9P - R\\u00b2 >0 and N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 >0. We saw an example where this leads to a solution. Let's see if there are other solutions.\\n\\nAlternatively, let's look for possible triples (P, Q, R) such that x=10^k.\\n\\nWe can start by checking possible values of P, R such that D=9P - R\\u00b2 is a divisor of N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2, and N/D=10^k.\\n\\nGiven that D divides N, and N/D=10^k, which is a power of 10, we can infer that D must be a factor of N, and the ratio N/D is a power of 10. Since 10^k is coprime with any factor of D that is not a factor of 10. Therefore, D must be composed of only factors 2 and 5, and possibly 1. But D=9P - R\\u00b2, which is 9P minus a square. Let's see.\\n\\nBut 9P - R\\u00b2 can be positive or negative. Let's first consider positive D.\\n\\nCase 1: D=9P - R\\u00b2 >0 and N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 >0.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9P - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 <9P\\n\\nand\\n\\n9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 >0 \\u21d29Q >9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nFrom R\\u00b2 <9P, substitute into the second inequality:\\n\\n9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 >9P +0=9P \\u21d29Q >9P \\u21d2Q >P\\n\\nSo Q >P in this case.\\n\\nAlso, since 9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 and R\\u00b2 <9P, we can write:\\n\\n9Q >9P + R\\u00b2 \\u21d2 Q >P + R\\u00b2/9\\n\\nBut since R\\u00b2 <9P, R\\u00b2/9 <P. Therefore:\\n\\nQ >P + (something less than P)\\n\\nBut since Q is at most 9, and P is at least 1, this might not restrict much.\\n\\nBut let's think about possible values of D=9P - R\\u00b2. Since D divides N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2, we have:\\n\\n(9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ) / (9P - R\\u00b2 )=10^k\\n\\nLet me denote R\\u00b2 =9P -D. Then substituting into N:\\n\\nN=9(Q - P) - (9P -D)=9Q -9P -9P +D=9Q -18P +D\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\nN/D= (9Q -18P +D)/D= (9Q -18P)/D +1=10^k\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n(9Q -18P)/D=10^k -1\\n\\nBut D=9P - R\\u00b2= D, so:\\n\\n9Q -18P= D*(10^k -1)\\n\\nBut D=9P - R\\u00b2, so:\\n\\n9Q -18P= (9P - R\\u00b2)*(10^k -1)\\n\\nThis seems complicated. Maybe let's try specific values.\\n\\nTake the example we had earlier: P=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1.\\n\\nHere, D=9*5 -7\\u00b2=45 -49= -4. Wait, but in this case, D is negative. Wait, but in this example, we had:\\n\\nN=9*(6 -5) -49=9 -49= -40\\n\\nD=9*5 -49= -4\\n\\nSo x= (-40)/(-4)=10=10^1. So even though D and N are negative, their ratio is positive. So this is part of the other case where both numerator and denominator are negative.\\n\\nTherefore, in this case:\\n\\nCase 2: D=9P - R\\u00b2 <0 and N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 <0.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d2 R\\u00b2 >9P\\n\\nand\\n\\n9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d29Q -9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d29Q <9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nSince R\\u00b2 >9P, we have 9Q <9P + R\\u00b2 <9P + R\\u00b2. But since R\\u00b2 >9P, this implies 9Q < something larger than 9P. But Q can be less than or greater than P.\\n\\nBut let's consider this case. Let's denote D=9P - R\\u00b2 <0, so D= -|D|, and N=9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 <0.\\n\\nTherefore, x= N/D= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ]/[9P - R\\u00b2 ]= [negative]/[negative]=positive.\\n\\nSo x= [ -9(P - Q) - R\\u00b2 ]/[ - (R\\u00b2 -9P) ]= [9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2 ]/[ R\\u00b2 -9P ]\\n\\nThus, x= [9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2 ]/[ R\\u00b2 -9P ]=10^k\\n\\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\\n\\n[9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2 ]=10^k*( R\\u00b2 -9P )\\n\\nLet's rearrange:\\n\\n9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2=10^k R\\u00b2 -9*10^k P\\n\\nBring all terms to left:\\n\\n9(P - Q) + R\\u00b2 -10^k R\\u00b2 +9*10^k P=0\\n\\nFactor terms with R\\u00b2 and P:\\n\\nR\\u00b2(1 -10^k) +9P(1 +10^k) -9Q=0\\n\\nThis is similar to the previous equation.\\n\\nBut again, it's complex. However, we can use the example we had:\\n\\nP=5, Q=6, R=7, k=1.\\n\\nPlug into the equation:\\n\\nR\\u00b2(1 -10^1) +9*5*(1 +10^1) -9*6=49*(1 -10) +45*(11) -54=49*(-9) +495 -54= -441 +495 -54=0. Correct.\\n\\nTherefore, we need to find all triples (P, Q, R) such that this equation holds for some k.\\n\\nGiven that k must be a positive integer \\u22642018, and x=10^k, which is unique for each k, each solution (P, Q, R, k) must satisfy this equation for exactly one k.\\n\\nNow, the key is to find all such triples (P, Q, R) where the equation holds for some k, and then count the number of such quadruples (including the k values).\\n\\nBut since k is determined by the equation (k= log_10(x)), and x must be 10^k, we can for each valid (P, Q, R), compute x and check if it's a power of 10, and if so, check if k= log_10(x) is an integer \\u22642018.\\n\\nGiven that x= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ]/[9P - R\\u00b2 ]=10^k, we can precompute possible values of x and see if they correspond to powers of 10.\\n\\nBut since P, Q, R are digits from 1 to 9, let's try to find all possible triples (P, Q, R) that satisfy the equation.\\n\\nLet me consider possible values of R and P such that R\\u00b2 >9P (since D=9P - R\\u00b2 <0 in this case). For each R from 2 to 9 (since R=1 would give R\\u00b2=1 <9P for P\\u22651), and P from 1 to floor(R\\u00b2/9). For example:\\n\\nR=2: R\\u00b2=4. P must satisfy 9P <4 \\u21d2 P <4/9 \\u21d2 P=1 invalid since 9*1=9 >4. So R=2 cannot be used here.\\n\\nR=3: R\\u00b2=9. 9P <9 \\u21d2 P <1. No solution.\\n\\nR=4: R\\u00b2=16. 9P <16 \\u21d2 P <16/9\\u22481.78 \\u21d2 P=1.\\n\\nR=5: R\\u00b2=25. 9P <25 \\u21d2 P \\u22642 (since 9*2=18 <25, 9*3=27>25)\\n\\nR=6: R\\u00b2=36. 9P <36 \\u21d2 P <4 \\u21d2 P=1,2,3\\n\\nR=7: R\\u00b2=49. 9P <49 \\u21d2 P \\u22645 (9*5=45 <49)\\n\\nR=8: R\\u00b2=64. 9P <64 \\u21d2 P \\u22647 (9*7=63 <64)\\n\\nR=9: R\\u00b2=81. 9P <81 \\u21d2 P \\u22648 (9*8=72 <81)\\n\\nTherefore, for each R from 4 to 9, and P from 1 to floor(R\\u00b2/9), we can compute Q such that:\\n\\nx= [9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 ]/[9P - R\\u00b2 ]=10^k\\n\\nBut since denominator is negative (D=9P - R\\u00b2 <0), and numerator must also be negative, we have:\\n\\n9(Q - P) - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d29Q -9P - R\\u00b2 <0 \\u21d29Q <9P + R\\u00b2\\n\\nBut since R\\u00b2 >9P, this is possible for Q in a certain range.\\n\\nLet me proceed step by step for each R from 4 to 9.\\n\\nCase R=4:\\n\\nR=4, R\\u00b2=16. P can be 1 (since 9*1=9 <16)\\n\\nSo P=1.\\n\\nWe need to find Q such that:\\n\\nx= [9(Q -1) -16 ]/[9*1 -16 ]= [9Q -9 -16]/[ -7 ]= (9Q -25)/(-7)=10^k\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n(9Q -25)/(-7)=10^k \\u21d2 (25 -9Q)/7=10^k\\n\\nSince 25 -9Q must be divisible by 7 and positive (since x=10^k >0).\\n\\nSo 25 -9Q >0 \\u21d29Q <25 \\u21d2Q \\u22642 (since 9*3=27 >25)\\n\\nQ can be 1 or 2.\\n\\nCheck Q=1:\\n\\n(25 -9*1)/7=16/7\\u22482.2857 Not integer.\\n\\nQ=2:\\n\\n(25 -18)/7=7/7=1=10^0. But k must be \\u22651. Therefore, invalid.\\n\\nTherefore, no solutions for R=4.\\n\\nCase R=5:\\n\\nR=5, R\\u00b2=25.

For example, let's check if there are other solutions with k=2.\\n\\nTake the example we found: (P=7, Q=3, R=8, k=2).

So no.\\n\\nAlternatively, let's see if there are other solutions with k=2.\\n\\nSuppose we have:\\n\\nFor k=2, the equation is:\\n\\nP_{(4)} - Q_{(2)}= (R_{(2)})\\u00b2\\n\\nWhich is:\\n\\nP*(10^4 -1)/9 - Q*(10^2 -1)/9 = (R*(10^2 -1)/9 )\\u00b2\\n\\nMultiply through by 9:\\n\\nP*(10000 -1) - Q*(99) = (R*99/9 )\\u00b2\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nP*9999 - Q*99 = (11R)^2\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n9999P -99Q = 121R\\u00b2\\n\\nDivide both sides by 11:\\n\\n909P -9Q =11R\\u00b2\\n\\nCheck if there are solutions here other than the one we found (P=7, Q=3, R=8):\\n\\nPlug in P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n909*7 -9*3=6363 -27=6336\\n\\n11*8\\u00b2=11*64=704. Wait, 6336 vs 704. Not equal. Wait, but earlier we saw that for k=2, 7777 -33=7744=88\\u00b2. Wait, but according to this equation:\\n\\nFor k=2:\\n\\n9999P -99Q =121R\\u00b2\\n\\nFor P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n9999*7 -99*3=69993 -297=69696\\n\\n121*8\\u00b2=121*64=7744. Wait, 69696 vs7744. Not equal. Wait, something's wrong here.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, the equation for k=2 is:\\n\\nP_{(4)} - Q_{(2)}= (R_{(2)})\\u00b2\\n\\nFor P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n7777 -33=7744=88\\u00b2. Correct.\\n\\nBut according to the equation:\\n\\n9999P -99Q =121R\\u00b2\\n\\nFor P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n9999*7=69993\\n\\n99*3=297\\n\\n69993 -297=69696\\n\\n121*8\\u00b2=121*64=7744\\n\\nBut 69696 \\u22607744. This discrepancy arises because when we multiplied through by 9, we should have:\\n\\nOriginal equation:\\n\\nP_{(4)} - Q_{(2)}= (R_{(2)})\\u00b2\\n\\nWhich is:\\n\\n(1111*P) - (11*Q) = (11*R)^2\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n1111P -11Q =121R\\u00b2\\n\\nDivide both sides by 11:\\n\\n101P -Q =11R\\u00b2\\n\\nAh, that's the correct equation. So for P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n101*7 -3=707 -3=704\\n\\n11*8\\u00b2=704. Correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the equation is 101P -Q=11R\\u00b2.\\n\\nSo solving 101P -Q=11R\\u00b2 where P, Q, R are digits from 1-9.\\n\\nWe already have the solution P=7, Q=3, R=8:\\n\\n101*7 -3=707-3=704=11*64=11*8\\u00b2.\\n\\nAre there other solutions?\\n\\nLet's check for other R:\\n\\nR=1:11*1=11. 101P -Q=11. Since P\\u22651, 101*1 -Q=11 \\u21d2Q=90. Invalid (Q must be \\u22649).\\n\\nR=2:11*4=44. 101P -Q=44. P=1:101 -Q=44 \\u21d2Q=57. Invalid.\\n\\nR=3:11*9=99. 101P -Q=99. P=1:101 -Q=99 \\u21d2Q=2. Valid. So P=1, Q=2, R=3.\\n\\nCheck if this works:\\n\\nFor k=2: P=1, Q=2, R=3.\\n\\nP_{(4)}=1111, Q_{(2)}=22, R_{(2)}=33.\\n\\n1111 -22=1089=33\\u00b2. Correct. So this is another solution.\\n\\nBut wait, this solution was already counted in the first case where 9P - R\\u00b2=0. For P=1, R=3: 9*1 -9=0. So this solution is already included in the first case (k=2). Therefore, when k=2, this quadruple (1,2,3,2) is part of the first case.\\n\\nSimilarly, R=4:11*16=176. 101P -Q=176. P=2:202 -Q=176 \\u21d2Q=26. Invalid.\\n\\nR=5:11*25=275. 101P -Q=275. P=3:303 -Q=275 \\u21d2Q=28. Invalid.\\n\\nR=6:11*36=396. 101P -Q=396. P=4:404 -Q=396 \\u21d2Q=8. Valid. So P=4, Q=8, R=6.\\n\\nCheck this:\\n\\nFor k=2: P=4, Q=8, R=6.\\n\\nP_{(4)}=\"\n",

    "target_q_chosen = \"\"\"\n",
    "<think>\n",
    "Okay, so I need to find the median of a list that has 4040 numbers. The list is made up of two parts: the first part is the numbers from 1 to 2020, and the second part is the squares of those same numbers, so 1², 2², 3², all the way up to 2020². The median is going to be the average of the 2020th and 2021st numbers when they're sorted in order. Since there are 4040 numbers in total, which is even, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let me make sure I understand the problem. We have two sequences: linear numbers 1 to 2020 and their squares. Combined, they form a list of 4040 numbers. I need to sort this combined list and find the median. Since the list is even-sized, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, positions 2020 and 2021 in the sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm. The key here is figuring out where the transition happens between the original numbers and their squares in the sorted list. Since the squares grow much faster than the linear numbers, after a certain point, the squares will be larger than the linear numbers. So, up to some number k, the linear number k is less than its square k², but beyond that, the squares are all larger. Wait, actually, for numbers greater than 1, the square is always larger. For k=1, 1=1². For k=2, 2 < 4, k=3, 3 < 9, etc. So actually, all squares from 2² onwards are larger than their original numbers. So in the sorted list, the number 1 will appear twice (once as 1 and once as 1²). Then starting from 2, each square will be larger than the original number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the sorted list will be a combination of the linear numbers and their squares, but each square (except 1²) will be interspersed later in the list. However, since the squares grow quadratically, they will eventually dominate and take up the latter half of the list. But since we have 2020 linear numbers and 2020 squares, the median will be around the 2020th element, which is near the end of the linear numbers and the start of the squares. Wait, but how exactly are they ordered?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me think. For each number k from 1 to 2020, we have two entries: k and k². When we sort the entire list, the numbers will be arranged from smallest to largest. For k ≥ 2, k² is larger than k, so each square will come after its corresponding linear number. However, as k increases, k² becomes much larger, so the squares of smaller numbers might be interspersed among the linear numbers of larger numbers. For example, 2² = 4 is less than 5, 6, etc., so in the sorted list, after 4 (the square), we have 5, 6, etc. Similarly, 3² = 9 is less than 10, 11, etc. So each square k² will be placed between the linear numbers k and k+1². Wait, no. Let's take an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a smaller case. Suppose instead of 2020, we have numbers up to 5. Then the list would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. When sorted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 9, 16, 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here, the linear numbers and their squares are interleaved. The original numbers 1-5 and their squares. The squares of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Sorted, they interleave such that squares of smaller numbers are among the linear numbers of larger numbers. For example, 4 (square of 2) comes after 3 and 4 (linear) in the sorted list. Wait, but in this example, after 4 (linear) comes 4 (square of 2). Hmm. So in this case, the squares start to interleave once k² is larger than k but smaller than k+1. Wait, no. For example, 2²=4, which is equal to the linear number 4. So in the sorted list, they are adjacent. Similarly, 3²=9, which would come after 9 in the linear list. But in the original list, the linear numbers only go up to 5 in this example, so 9 is beyond that. Wait, in the example with up to 5, the squares are 1,4,9,16,25. So sorted combined list is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1,1,2,3,4,4,5,9,16,25.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here, the squares of 2, 3, 4, 5 are all larger than the linear numbers beyond 4. So in this case, the squares after 4 (linear) are 4 (square of 2), but wait, no. Wait, the linear number 4 is in the original list, and the square of 2 is 4. So in the sorted list, both 4s are next to each other. Then comes 5, then 9, etc. So in this case, the squares of the smaller numbers (2, 3, 4, 5) are interleaved with the linear numbers. However, once the squares exceed the maximum linear number (which is 5 in this case), they just trail off.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the original problem, the linear numbers go up to 2020, and the squares go up to 2020². So in this case, for k from 1 to 2020, each square k² is at least as big as k, but for k up to 2020, k² can be as big as 2020², which is way larger than the linear numbers. So when we merge the two lists (linear and squares), the sorted list will start with 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 9, 6, 16, ..., wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the sorted list is just all the numbers from the linear list and the squares list merged in order. So for numbers where k² is less than or equal to 2020, the square k² will be inserted into the linear list at position k². For example, 2²=4 will be inserted after the linear 4. Wait, but in the original linear list, we already have 4. So when merging, the squares that are less than or equal to 2020 will be interleaved with the linear numbers, while the squares that are greater than 2020 will come after the linear number 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the combined sorted list, the numbers will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 (from linear), 1 (from square), 2 (linear), 3 (linear), 4 (linear), 4 (square of 2), 5 (linear), 6 (linear), ..., up to 2020 (linear), and then the squares from k where k² > 2020. Wait, but k² > 2020 would start at k = ceil(sqrt(2020)). Let's compute sqrt(2020). sqrt(2020) is approx 44.944. So starting at k=45, k²=2025, which is greater than 2020. Therefore, the squares from k=45 to 2020 will be larger than 2020, so in the sorted list, they will come after the linear number 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the sorted list can be divided into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The numbers from 1 to 44, each appearing twice: once as linear and once as square. Except for 1, which is 1², so 1 appears twice. Then from 2 to 44, their squares are 4, 9, 16, ..., 1936 (44²=1936). These squares are all less than 2020, so they are interspersed within the linear numbers up to 1936, and then from 1937 to 2020, there are only linear numbers. Then starting from 45²=2025, the squares are larger than 2020, so those squares start at 2025 and go up to 2020², which is 4,080,400.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, let's verify that. So for k from 1 to 44, k² is less than 2020? Let's check 44²: 44*44 = 1936. 45² = 2025. So yes, the squares of numbers 1 through 44 are 1, 4, 9, ..., 1936. All of these are less than 2020, so in the combined sorted list, these squares will be inserted into the linear list at their respective positions. Then from 45 to 2020, their squares are 2025 up to 2020², which are all greater than 2020. So in the sorted list, after the linear number 2020, we have all the squares from 45² to 2020².\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the sorted list is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The numbers from 1 to 2020 in linear order, but with squares inserted wherever k² is less than 2020. Specifically, for each k from 1 to 44, the square k² is inserted into the linear list at position k². Then, after the linear number 2020, we have all the squares from 45² to 2020² in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "But actually, inserting k² into the linear list would displace the subsequent numbers. Wait, perhaps not exactly inserting, but when merging two sorted lists: the linear list [1,2,3,...,2020] and the squares list [1,4,9,...,2020²]. So merging them would result in a sorted list where for each k from 1 to 44, the square k² is less than 2020, so they are placed in between the linear numbers. For example, 2²=4 is placed after 4 in the linear list, but since 4 is already present, the square 4 would come after the linear 4. Wait, no. Wait, when merging two sorted lists, duplicates are allowed, so the square 4 (from k=2) is equal to the linear 4 (from k=4). So in the merged list, they would be adjacent. Similarly, 3²=9 is equal to the linear 9, so 9 would appear twice. Wait, but the original linear list is 1 to 2020, each number once, and the squares list is 1² to 2020², each number once. Therefore, in the merged list, numbers that are both in the linear list and the squares list will appear twice. For example, 1 (from linear and square), 4 (from linear k=4 and square k=2), 9 (from linear k=9 and square k=3), ..., up to 44²=1936 (from linear k=1936 and square k=44). Then, starting from 45²=2025, the squares are not present in the linear list, so they appear once each after 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the merged sorted list is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 (linear), 1 (square), 2, 3, 4 (linear), 4 (square), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (linear), 9 (square), 10, ..., 1936 (linear), 1936 (square), 1937, 1938, ..., 2020, 2025, 2026, ..., 4080400.\n",
    "\n",
    "So each perfect square from 1² to 44² appears twice (once as linear, once as square), and the numbers from 45² to 2020² appear only once, after 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but hold on. For example, the square 4 comes from k=2, but the linear 4 comes from k=4. So in the merged list, both 4s are present. Similarly, the square 9 comes from k=3, and the linear 9 comes from k=9. So these are separate entries. Therefore, in the merged list, numbers that are perfect squares between 1 and 1936 will have two entries: one from the linear list and one from the squares list. All other numbers (non-squares and squares greater than 2020) will have one entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total number of numbers up to 2020 in the merged list is 2020 (from the linear list) plus 44 (squares from k=1 to 44, since their squares are ≤ 1936). Wait, no. Wait, the squares list has entries from k=1 to 2020, so squares from k=1 to 44 are ≤ 44²=1936, and squares from k=45 to 2020 are ≥ 2025. So in the merged list, the numbers from 1 to 2020 include both the linear numbers and the squares that are ≤ 2020. So how many duplicates are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each square from k=1 to 44 is a duplicate in the sense that they are present in both the linear list and the squares list. For example, the square 1 (k=1) is already in the linear list as 1 (k=1). Similarly, square 4 (k=2) is in the linear list as 4 (k=4). So the number of duplicates is 44 (from k=1 to 44, each square k² is present in the linear list as the number k² when k² is between 1 and 2020). Wait, actually, for k from 1 to 44, k² can be as large as 44²=1936. Therefore, the numbers in the linear list that are perfect squares between 1 and 1936 are duplicates with the squares list. So how many duplicates are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of duplicates is equal to the number of perfect squares between 1 and 1936. Since 44²=1936, there are 44 perfect squares (1², 2², ..., 44²). Each of these numbers appears twice in the merged list: once from the linear list and once from the squares list. Therefore, the total count of numbers up to 1936 in the merged list is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of linear numbers from 1 to 1936: 1936 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of squares from 1² to 44²: 44 numbers, each of which duplicates a number in the linear list. So in the merged list, these 44 squares add 44 extra numbers, making the total count from 1 to 1936 equal to 1936 + 44 = 1980.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, from 1937 to 2020, the linear list continues, and there are no squares in this range because the next square after 44²=1936 is 45²=2025. Therefore, from 1937 to 2020, there are 2020 - 1936 = 84 numbers, all from the linear list.\n",

    "Additionally, after 2020, we have the squares from 45²=2025 to 2020²=4,080,400. The number of these squares is 2020 - 44 = 1976. Wait, because k starts at 45 and goes to 2020, so 2020 - 44 = 1976 numbers. So these are added after 2020 in the merged list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total numbers in the merged list can be broken down as:\n",

Therefore, position 1981 is 1937, position 1982 is 1938, ..., position 1981 + 39 = 2020 is 1976. Then position 2021 is 1977.\n",

    "\n",
    "But wait, the problem says the list is [1, 2, 3, ..., 2020, 1², 2², 3², ..., 2020²]. When merged, the sorted list is as described. So according to this, the median is 1976.5. But the problem is asking for the median, which in the case of two integers, would be a number with a .5. But the problem might expect an integer, but maybe it's acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let's check again.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's confirm the number of elements in each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1: numbers from 1 to 1936, with duplicates. Each of the squares from 1² to 44²=1936 is present twice. So the count here is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of linear numbers from 1 to 1936: 1936.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of squares from 1² to 44²: 44.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, the squares from 1² to 44² are already included in the linear numbers. Wait, no. Wait, the squares list is separate. So for example, 1²=1 is in the squares list, but 1 is also in the linear list. Similarly, 2²=4 is in the squares list, and 4 is in the linear list. So when merged, these duplicates are present. So the total number of elements in the merged list up to 1936 is 1936 (linear) + 44 (squares) = 1980. That's correct because each square from 1² to 44² adds an extra element to the merged list. For example, 1 is in both lists, so merged list has two 1s. 4 is in both lists, so merged list has two 4s, etc., up to 44²=1936, which is in both lists. Therefore, each square from 1 to 44 adds one duplicate, hence 44 duplicates. So total elements up to 1936: 1936 + 44 = 1980. Correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, from 1937 to 2020, there are 2020 - 1936 = 84 linear numbers, no squares. So that adds 84 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the squares from 45²=2025 to 2020²=4,080,400. There are 2020 - 44 = 1976 squares here. So 1976 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total: 1980 + 84 + 1976 = 4040. Correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the elements from 1937 to 2020 are in positions 1981 to 2064. So position 1981:1937, 1982:1938, ..., position 2064:2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the 2020th element is at position 2020. Since 1980 elements are before the 1937-2020 range, the 2020th element is the (2020 - 1980) = 40th element in the 1937-2020 range. The 40th element is 1937 + 39 = 1976. Then the 2021st element is the 41st element in that range: 1937 + 40 = 1977.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, median is (1976 + 1977)/2 = 1976.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the problem is stated as giving a list of numbers, so the median would be the average of the two middle numbers if it's not an integer. However, in some contexts, medians are reported as fractions even if they're not integers. So the answer should be 1976.5, which is 1976.5. But the problem might expect a fractional answer boxed as \\boxed{1976.5}, but given that the original numbers are integers, sometimes the median is presented as a fraction. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, let's cross-verify with another approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative approach: The merged list has 4040 numbers. The median is the average of the 2020th and 2021st numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find these numbers, we need to determine how many numbers are less than or equal to a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider that up to number k in the linear list, we have k numbers. The squares less than or equal to k would be floor(sqrt(k)). But this might complicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, let's think of the merged list as the union of two sorted lists: A (linear numbers 1 to 2020) and B (squares 1² to 2020²). The merged list is the combination of A and B, sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that for each k from 1 to 44, the square k² is in both A and B (since k² ≤ 2020). For k from 45 to 2020, the square k² is only in B and is greater than 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the merged list, each number from 1 to 1936 (44²) appears twice (once from A, once from B), and each number from 1937 to 2020 appears once (only from A), and each number from 2025 (45²) to 2020² appears once (only from B).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total count is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2*44 = 88 duplicates for numbers 1² to 44² (but 1²=1 is also in A, so total duplicates here: 44 numbers duplicated, adding 44 elements)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, no. Wait, the linear list A has numbers 1 to 2020. The squares list B has numbers 1² to 2020². The intersection of A and B is the numbers that are perfect squares from 1² to 44² (since 44²=1936 <2020, and 45²=2025>2020). Therefore, the numbers that are in both A and B are 1, 4, 9, ..., 1936. There are 44 such numbers (k from 1 to 44). Therefore, in the merged list, each of these 44 numbers appears twice. All other numbers in A (non-squares from 2 to 2020) and in B (squares from 45² to 2020²) appear once. Therefore, the total count is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of elements in merged list = (2020 + 2020) - 44 = 4040 - 44 = 3996? Wait, no. Wait, when you merge two lists with duplicates, the total count is the sum of both lists minus the number of duplicates. But in this case, the duplicates are the 44 numbers that are in both A and B. Each duplicate appears twice in the merged list. Wait, no. Wait, the merged list is the union of A and B, but sorted. So each element in A or B is included once. However, if a number is in both A and B, it is included twice. Therefore, the total count is |A| + |B| = 2020 + 2020 = 4040. Because even if numbers are duplicated, they are present in both lists. For example, the number 4 is in A (as 4) and in B (as 2²). So in the merged list, it appears twice. Therefore, the total count is indeed 4040, as stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the merged list has 44 numbers duplicated (appearing twice) and the rest appearing once. So the structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For numbers 1, 4, 9, ..., 1936: each appears twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For numbers 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, ..., 1937, ..., 2020: each appears once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For numbers 2025, 2026, ..., 4,080,400: each appears once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when sorted, the merged list will have two instances of each square up to 1936, and single instances of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, to find the 2020th and 2021st elements, we can calculate the cumulative counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's compute how many numbers are there before the linear number 1937.\n",

    "- Linear numbers: 1 to 1936 (1936 numbers)\n",

    "- Squares: 1² to 44² (44 numbers), each adding an extra number in the merged list.\n",

    "Therefore, total numbers up to 1936: 1936 + 44 = 1980.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, the first 1980 numbers are up to 1936, with duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next 84 numbers are 1937 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the 2020th number is the (2020 - 1980) = 40th number in the 1937-2020 range.\n",

    "Therefore, the median is (1976 + 1977)/2 = 1976.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the problem is about a list of numbers, which are all integers. The median of two integers is allowed to be a half-integer, so 1976.5 is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 1976.5, which in boxed form is \\boxed{1976.5}.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, let me check again. Because sometimes in programming or math problems, the median of an even number of integers can be a non-integer, which is acceptable. So 1976.5 is the correct median.\n",

    "Yes, that's correct. So positions 1981 to 2064 correspond to numbers 1937 to 2020. Therefore, each position increment corresponds to a number increment of 1. Therefore, position 1981 + n = 1937 + n.\n",

    "Wait, no. If position 1981 is 1937, then position 1981 + 1 is 1938, ..., position 1981 + k is 1937 + k. Therefore, position 2020 is 1981 + (2020 - 1981) = 1981 + 39 = 2020. Wait, position 2020 is 1937 + 39 = 1976.\n",

    "For k from 1 to 44, k² is less than or equal to 1936, which is in the linear list. So these squares will be placed within the linear numbers. For k from 45 to 2020, k² is greater than 2020, so these squares are placed after the linear numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the merged list, before 1937, we have duplicates for the squares, and after 1937, we have linear numbers up to 2020, then squares from 45² upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the number of elements before 1937 is 1936 (linear) + 44 (squares) = 1980.\n",

    "Number of elements from 1937 to 2020: 84.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of elements from 2025 onwards: 1976.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, positions 2020 and 2021 lie within the 1937-2020 range.\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe there's an error in counting the number of elements before 1937. Let me verify:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers from 1 to 1936: each number from 1 to 1936 appears once in the linear list. Additionally, the squares from 1² to 44²=1936 appear once each in the squares list. Therefore, for numbers that are perfect squares (1, 4, 9, ..., 1936), they appear twice in the merged list. The count of these squares is 44 (since sqrt(1936) = 44). Therefore, the total number of elements up to 1936 is 1936 (linear) + 44 (extra squares) = 1980. That seems correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the calculation holds. Therefore, the median is 1976.5. However, since the problem is presented in a mathematical context, perhaps expecting an exact answer, but as a fraction, it would be 3953/2, which is 1976.5. But in the boxed answer, we can write it as \\boxed{1976.5}.\n",

For example, an in-shuffle performed on the list $P Q R S T U$ gives the new list $P S Q T R U$. A second in-shuffle now gives the list $P T S R Q U$. Ping has a list of the 66 integers from 1 to 66, arranged in increasing order. He performs 1000 in-shuffles on this list, recording the new list each time. In how many of these 1001 lists is the number 47 in the 24th position? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\\\boxed{}.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "First, let's make sure I understand what an in-shuffle is. The problem says that an in-shuffle splits the deck into two equal halves, the first half goes into the odd positions, and the second half goes into the even positions. So, if we have a list of 6 elements: P Q R S T U, after one in-shuffle, it becomes P S Q T R U. Then another in-shuffle would make it P T S R Q U. Okay, so each time, the first half is interleaved with the second half, with the first half's elements in the odd positions and the second half's in the even positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to track where the number 47 moves after each in-shuffle. Specifically, we want to know when it's in position 24. The original list (before any shuffles) is in order, so position 24 is just 24. After the first shuffle, it's somewhere else, and so on. We need to find out how many times, over 1001 lists (including the original), 47 is in position 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm. Let's think about permutations. Each in-shuffle is a permutation of the positions. If we can model where position 24 goes after each shuffle, or equivalently, where a card moves after each shuffle, we can track when 47 ends up there.\n",
    "\n",
    "But maybe it's easier to model the position of the number 47 after each shuffle and see when that position is 24. Let's see.\n",

    "Let me denote the position of number 47 after n shuffles as f(n). We need to find all n between 0 and 1000 inclusive such that f(n) = 24.\n",

So, for example, in the original list, position 1 stays in position 1, position 2 moves to position k+1, position 3 moves to position 2, position 4 moves to position k+2, etc. Wait, maybe not. Let's think with the example given.\n",

    "- Original position 5 (T) → new position 4\n",

    "For the first half (positions 1 to k): new_position = 2*original_position - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second half (positions k+1 to 2k): new_position = 2*(original_position - k)\n",

    "Wait, let's test this. For original position 4 (k=3, so second half starts at 4):\n",
    "\n",
    "new_position = 2*(4 - 3) = 2*1 = 2, which matches. Original position 5: 2*(5 - 3) = 4. Position 6: 2*(6 - 3) = 6. That works. And for the first half: position 1: 2*1 - 1 = 1, position 2: 2*2 - 1 = 3, position 3: 2*3 -1 = 5. Perfect.\n",

    "\n",
    "If original position is > k: new position = 2*(original_position - k)\n",

    "If current position is even: previous position = k + current position / 2\n",

    "If position > 33: new position = 2*(position - 33)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but positions are 1 to 66. Let's confirm with the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, 6 cards, k=3. Original position 4: new position 2. So 2*(4 - 3) = 2. Correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, position 2: 2*2 -1 = 3. Correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, that formula works. So, for our problem with 66 cards, k=33.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given a current position p, after one in-shuffle, the new position is:\n",

    "If p ≤ 33: 2p -1\n",
    "\n",
    "If p > 33: 2(p -33)\n",

    "So, to track where 47 moves, we can model this as a permutation cycle.\n",

    "First, since 47 > 33, after first shuffle, it goes to 2*(47 - 33) = 2*14 = 28.\n",

The condition is that for each element from the second one onwards (i.e., from b_2 to b_7), either the number that is 2 more or 2 less than that element (or both) must have appeared earlier in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, so essentially, each number after the first one must be adjacent in value to at least one number that's already been placed before it. Let me parse that again. For example, if the first number is 1, then the next number could be 3 (since 1 is 2 less than 3), or maybe 1 again, but since we need a list of distinct integers (wait, does the problem say they have to be distinct? Let me check. It says \"a list of the first 7 odd positive integers\", so I think they have to be all included once each. So it's a permutation of these seven numbers with the given condition.\n",

This kind of problem is sometimes called a \"linear extension\" or \"permutation with adjacency constraints\", but I need to think about how to model this.\n",

Similarly, for n=1, it's 1=2^0. For n=2, the permutations are [1,3] and [3,1], so 2=2^(2-1). So maybe in general, for a linear chain of m nodes, the number of such permutations is 2^(m-1).

So after 5,3, next can be 1 or 7. If we take 1, then next is 7. If we take 7, then next is 1. So permutations: 5,3,1,7; 5,3,7,1. Similarly, if starting with 5,7: next can be 3 or 1? Wait, 5,7: next must be adjacent to 5 or 7. 3 is adjacent to 5 (5-2=3), 9 is not in the list. Wait, our numbers are only up to 7. So after 5,7, next can be 3. Then after 5,7,3, next is 1.

    "Okay, so I need to find the number of lists of the integers from 4 to 15 inclusive, which are 12 numbers in total. The condition is that for each position from the second one onwards (i.e., from i=2 to i=12), the number at that position, let's call it b_i, must have either b_i + 1 or b_i - 1 or both somewhere before it in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We are arranging the numbers 4 through 15 in some order, but each number after the first has to be adjacent (in value) to at least one number that comes before it in the list. This seems similar to constructing a permutation where each new element is adjacent to some previous element. In graph theory terms, if we consider numbers as nodes and connect each pair of numbers that differ by 1, then this is like building up a permutation where each new node is connected to the existing graph. Since the numbers 4 through 15 form a linear chain (each number is connected to its predecessor and successor), this is essentially counting the number of linear extensions or something similar? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, this problem resembles the number of permutations of the numbers 4 to 15 such that each element after the first is adjacent in value to at least one previous element. Such permutations are sometimes called \"linear permutations\" or \"connected permutations\" where the permutation forms a single segment as it builds up. This concept is similar to constructing a connected graph incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "I remember that for such permutations of the numbers 1 to n where each new element is adjacent to at least one previous element, the number is 2^{n-1}. But wait, is that the case here? Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose we have numbers 1, 2, 3. How many such permutations are there? Let's see:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with any number. Let's say we start with 1. Then the next number has to be 2 (since 1+1=2). Then the third number has to be 3. Similarly, if we start with 3, then the next number has to be 2, then 1. If we start with 2, then the next number can be 1 or 3. Suppose we start with 2, then 1. Then the third number can only be 3. Similarly, starting with 2, then 3, then 1. So for n=3, the number of such permutations is 2 (starting with 1 or 3, leading to one permutation each) plus 2 (starting with 2, leading to two permutations). Total 4, which is 2^{3-1}=4. So that formula works here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for n=2, starting with either 1 or 2. If you start with 1, the next has to be 2. If you start with 2, the next has to be 1. So two permutations, which is 2^{2-1}=2. So the formula seems to hold. So in general, for numbers 1 to n arranged in such a way, the number is 2^{n-1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in our problem, the numbers are from 4 to 15, which is 12 numbers. If they were from 1 to 12, then the number would be 2^{11}=2048. But here, the numbers are shifted by 3. Does the shift affect the count? Let me think. Since the adjacency is based on numerical difference, not their absolute positions, shifting all numbers by a constant shouldn't affect the number of valid permutations. For example, the numbers 4 to 15 are just like numbers 1 to 12 shifted by 3. The adjacency relationships are preserved: 4 is adjacent to 5, 5 to 6, etc., just like 1 is adjacent to 2, 2 to 3, etc. Therefore, the number of such permutations should be the same as if we were dealing with numbers 1 to 12. Hence, 2^{11}=2048.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm with n=3 shifted. Suppose we have numbers 4,5,6. How many permutations? Let's see. Start with 4: next must be 5, then 6. Start with 6: next must be 5, then 4. Start with 5: next can be 4 or 6. If next is 4, then the third must be 6. If next is 6, then third must be 4. So total permutations: 2 (starting with 4 or 6) plus 2 (starting with 5 and then 4 or 6). So total 4, which is 2^{3-1}=4. So even shifted, the count is the same. Therefore, shifting the numbers doesn't affect the count. Therefore, in our problem, the number of such permutations should be 2^{12-1}=2048.\n",

    "Wait, but the problem statement says \"a list of the 12 integers from 4 to 15 inclusive\". So n=12. Then, following the earlier logic, the number of such permutations should be 2^{n-1}=2^{11}=2048. So is the answer 2048? That seems too straightforward, and the problem is presented as if it's more complicated, so maybe I'm missing something here.\n",

For example, if you have numbers 4 to 15, once you have a starting number, each subsequent number must be adjacent to the current minimum or maximum. Therefore, the number of such permutations is 2^{n-1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, here's another way to think about it. Suppose you have the numbers arranged in a line: 4,5,6,...,15. To build a permutation where each new number is adjacent to the existing set, you must start at some number and then each subsequent number must be adjacent to the current interval. So, the number of such permutations is equal to the number of ways to start at any number and then at each step extend the interval to the left or right. However, once you fix the starting number, the number of permutations is 2^{n-1}. But since you can start at any number, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if you have a connected interval, once you start at a particular number, you can only extend to the left or right. So if you start at a number that's not the leftmost or rightmost, then you have two choices each time. But actually, in the problem, the starting number can be any of the 12 numbers. However, once you choose the starting number, the rest of the permutation is determined by choosing at each step to add to the left or right end of the current interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but actually, if you start with any number, then the next number has to be either one more or one less than the starting number. Then, as you build up, each subsequent number must be adjacent to the current interval. So in effect, this is equivalent to building the permutation by starting at some point and then at each step expanding the interval to the left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this model, the number of permutations would be 12 * 2^{11 -1} }? Wait, no. Wait, if you can start anywhere, but once you start, each subsequent step has 2 choices (extend left or right). Wait, but the starting number is arbitrary, but once you fix the starting number, the number of permutations is 2^{n-1}. For example, starting at the middle, each time you can extend left or right. Wait, but the starting number isn't necessarily the middle. Wait, actually, regardless of where you start, the number of permutations is 2^{n-1}. For example, if you start with the leftmost number, 4, then each subsequent number must be one more than the current maximum, so you have only one choice each time, right? Similarly, if you start with 15, the rightmost number, then each subsequent number must be one less than the current minimum. So in those cases, starting at the ends, you have only 1 permutation each. But if you start somewhere in the middle, say starting at 9, then you can choose to extend left or right at each step. So depending on the starting position, the number of permutations might vary. Wait, this contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, now I see the confusion. The initial assumption that the number of permutations is 2^{n-1} might not hold if the starting number is not in the middle. Wait, let's think with a smaller example. Suppose we have numbers 4,5,6 (n=3). If we start at 4, then the next number has to be 5, and then 6. So only 1 permutation. Similarly, starting at 6, next has to be 5, then 4. Starting at 5, next can be 4 or 6. If next is 4, then the last number is 6. If next is 6, then the last number is 4. So starting at 5 gives 2 permutations. Total permutations: 1 (start 4) +1 (start 6) +2 (start 5)=4, which is 2^{3-1}=4. So even though starting at the ends only give 1 permutation each, starting in the middle gives more. So overall, the total is 2^{n-1}.\n",

If it's 7, then the next number has to be 4. Wait, but we have two possibilities here. Wait, starting at 5, next is 6, then next can be 4 or 7. If we choose 4, then the last number is 7. If we choose 7, then the last number is 4. So starting at 5, we have two permutations: 5,6,4,7 and 5,6,7,4. Similarly, if starting at 5, first choosing 4: 5,4, then next must be 6, then 7. So that's another permutation. Wait, no. Wait, if we start at 5, then go to 4, then the next number must be adjacent to 4 or 5, which is 6 (since 4 is adjacent to 5, but 6 is adjacent to 5). So after 5,4, next is 6, then 7. So that's one permutation. So starting at 5, we have two choices at the second step: 4 or 6. If we choose 4, the rest is forced. If we choose 6, then at the third step, we have two choices again. Wait, no, after 5,6, the next number can be 4 or 7. So if starting at 5,6, then two choices, leading to two permutations. So starting at 5, total permutations: 1 (5,4,6,7) + 2 (5,6,4,7 and 5,6,7,4) = 3? Wait, but 5,4,6,7 is one, 5,6,4,7 and 5,6,7,4. Wait, but also, after 5,6,7, the last number is 4? Wait, no. After 5,6,7, the next number has to be adjacent to 7, which is 6 or 8. But 8 isn't in the set. So only 6, which is already present. Wait, but 4 hasn't been placed yet. Wait, no, if the numbers are 4,5,6,7. If we have placed 5,6,7, then the remaining number is 4. But 4 is adjacent to 5, which is already in the list. So can we place 4 at the end? Wait, but the rule is that when placing 4 (which is the last number), it needs to have either 4+1=5 or 4-1=3 in the previous numbers. Since 5 is already there, it's allowed. Wait, but in the permutation order, when you place 4 at the end, the previous elements are 5,6,7. So 4 is placed last, and it has 5 before it, which is 4+1. So that's allowed. So 5,6,7,4 is a valid permutation. Similarly, 5,6,4,7: After 5,6,4, the remaining number is 7, which is adjacent to 6, so allowed. Then 7 is placed last. So yes, starting at 5, we can have permutations: 5,4,6,7; 5,6,4,7; 5,6,7,4. So that's three permutations starting at 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Theory Insight**: The numbers 4 to 15 form a linear chain (each number is connected to its predecessor and successor). This problem is analogous to constructing a permutation where each new element is connected to the existing graph, forming a single connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Known Result**: For a set of numbers arranged in a linear chain, the number of valid permutations where each new element is adjacent to at least one previous element is \\(2^{n-1}\\) for \\(n\\) numbers. This result holds because each step after the first allows a choice of extending the interval to the left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Application to the Problem**: The numbers 4 to 15 are 12 numbers. Shifting the range does not affect the adjacency relationships. Therefore, the number of valid permutations is \\(2^{12-1} = 2^{11} = 2048\\).\n",

    "Okay, so I need to find the 111th term in the sequence of numbers that can be expressed as the sum of distinct repunits. Repunits are numbers like 1, 11, 111, 1111, etc., where every digit is 1. The problem says that the sequence a₁, a₂, a₃,… lists all positive integers that are sums of distinct repunits, ordered from smallest to largest. My task is to compute a₁₁₁.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A repunit of length n is Rₙ = (10ⁿ - 1)/9. For example, R₁ = 1, R₂ = 11, R₃ = 111, etc. The sequence aₙ consists of numbers that can be written as sums of distinct R's. So each aₙ is a sum where each repunit is used at most once.\n",

    "Since we need to list all such numbers in increasing order, the key is to figure out how these sums are structured and how to enumerate them properly. Since repunits can be of any length, but each can only be used once in a sum, this is similar to binary representations where each bit represents the presence or absence of a particular repunit. However, unlike binary numbers, the \"digits\" here have different weights, so the ordering isn't straightforward.\n",

    "R₂ = 11\n",
    "\n",
    "R₃ = 111\n",

    "R₄ = 1111\n",
    "\n",
    "R₅ = 11111\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on. These get exponentially larger as n increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider sums of distinct repunits, the possible sums would be combinations of these numbers. For example, the first few terms would be:\n",

    "But wait, ordering these numbers is not as simple as adding the next repunit. For instance, R₂ = 11 is 11, which is larger than 1 + R₁? Wait, no, R₁ is 1, so the first term is 1, then 11, then 1+11=12, then 111, then 1+111=112, 11+111=122, 1+11+111=123, then 1111, etc. So the ordering is not straightforward. Each time a new repunit is introduced, it's the next largest number, but combinations can fill in the gaps between the repunits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems similar to binary counting where each bit represents a repunit. For example, if we think of each repunit as a bit in a binary number, where the presence of a repunit is a 1 and absence is 0, then each number in the sequence can be represented by a binary string. However, the value of each \"bit\" here is a repunit instead of a power of 2. So instead of binary digits representing 2ⁿ, they represent R_{n+1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "But unlike binary numbers, the weights here are not powers of a base, but rather repunits, which grow exponentially but with a different base. For example, R₁=1, R₂=11=10+1=11, R₃=111=100+10+1=111, etc. Each Rₙ is (10ⁿ -1)/9, so their values are 1, 11, 111, 1111, etc. So each subsequent repunit is 10 times the previous one plus 1. This means they grow exponentially as 10ⁿ / 9 approximately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each repunit is much larger than the sum of all previous repunits, the way these numbers are ordered is similar to binary numbers where each next bit is more significant than all previous bits combined. For example, R₃ = 111 is larger than R₁ + R₂ = 1 + 11 = 12. So when we include a new repunit, it's the largest number so far, and all combinations with previous repunits will slot in between the previous largest number and the new repunit. Wait, actually, no. Since R₃ is 111, which is way bigger than R₂ (11). So when you include R₃, it's 111, and then adding R₁ or R₂ to it gives 112, 122, 123. But 112 is still bigger than R₂ + R₁ = 12. So perhaps each new repunit introduces a new set of numbers that are larger than all previous numbers. So the ordering of the sequence aₙ would first list all combinations of the smaller repunits, then the next repunit, then combinations of the next repunit with smaller ones, and so on.\n",

    "Wait, but this seems to be generating numbers in a way similar to binary counting, where each repunit is a bit, and the sum is the combination of bits. However, the problem is that when you have multiple repunits, their sum can create numbers that may not follow a simple binary order. For example, 11 (R₂) is 11, which is less than 111 (R₃), but when combined with smaller repunits, the numbers can be in between. However, given that each new repunit is significantly larger than the previous ones, the majority of the numbers in the sequence will be dominated by the largest repunit in their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in reality, when combining repunits, the numbers formed are like numbers in a positional number system where each digit can be 0 or 1, but each position has a weight of a repunit. However, since the repunits themselves are not powers of a base, but rather numbers like 1, 11, 111, 1111, etc., which are each 10 times the previous plus 1, their values grow exponentially. Therefore, the number of possible sums up to a certain point is similar to binary numbers, but the actual numerical values increase rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, since each repunit is an order of magnitude larger than the previous, the sums can be thought of as numbers in base 10 where each digit is either 0 or 1, but the digits are in positions corresponding to repunits. However, the key is that each \"digit\" here is a repunit, which complicates the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, perhaps this is analogous to binary numbers, where each bit corresponds to a repunit instead of a power of 2. For example, the number 1 in binary would correspond to R₁, 10 in binary would correspond to R₂, 11 in binary would correspond to R₁ + R₂, 100 would correspond to R₃, and so on. Therefore, the sequence aₙ is equivalent to interpreting binary numbers as sums of repunits, where each bit position represents the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of a particular repunit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that's the case, then each number in the sequence aₙ corresponds to a binary number, where each binary digit represents the presence or absence of a repunit. Therefore, the nth term in the sequence aₙ is the sum of repunits corresponding to the binary digits of n. Wait, but that might not hold because the ordering would be different. For example, in binary, the number 3 (11 in binary) represents R₁ + R₂ = 1 + 11 = 12, which would be a₃, which is correct. Similarly, binary 4 (100) would correspond to R₃ = 111, which is a₄. However, the problem is that the numerical values of these sums don't correspond to the order of binary numbers. For instance, 12 (binary 11) is 12, which is less than 111 (binary 100). So perhaps the sequence aₙ is exactly the numbers formed by treating the binary representations as indicators for which repunits to include, and then ordering those sums numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in that case, the sequence aₙ would be ordered based on the numerical value of the sum, not based on the binary number that represents the combination. Therefore, the key is to generate all possible subsets of the repunits, compute their sums, and then sort them. The problem is that generating all subsets is infeasible since repunits can be very large, and there are infinitely many. However, up to a certain point, the repunits are so large that including them would exceed the numbers we are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, perhaps the approach is similar to the binary representation, where each term in the sequence corresponds to a binary number with digits indicating which repunits are included, but ordered by their actual numerical value. However, because the repunits grow exponentially, each subsequent repunit is much larger than all previous ones combined. Therefore, the ordering of the sums is roughly determined by the largest repunit in the sum. So sums that include Rₙ will be ordered after all sums that don't include Rₙ or any larger repunits. Moreover, the sums that include Rₙ can be ordered by their combination with smaller repunits, which would be similar to the ordering of the numbers without Rₙ. Therefore, the entire sequence can be constructed recursively: for each new repunit Rₙ, the numbers formed by adding Rₙ to all previous sums (which don't include Rₙ) will come after all the numbers without Rₙ. Since Rₙ is larger than all previous sums, the numbers including Rₙ will be interleaved with the existing numbers? Wait, no. If Rₙ is larger than all previous numbers, then adding Rₙ to any sum will create a number larger than all previous numbers. Therefore, all numbers not including Rₙ are smaller than those that include Rₙ. Therefore, the sequence can be thought of as first listing all numbers that don't include Rₙ, then all numbers that include Rₙ. But since we can have multiple repunits, each new repunit adds a new set of numbers that are all larger than the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, actually, that's not quite right. For example, R₁ = 1, R₂ = 11, R₃ = 111, etc. If we have a sum like R₂ + R₃ = 11 + 111 = 122, which is larger than R₃ alone (111). However, when you introduce R₄ = 1111, which is larger than all previous numbers, but sums that include R₄ plus smaller repunits will be even larger. So actually, each time a new repunit is introduced, the next number in the sequence is the repunit itself, followed by the repunit plus all combinations of smaller repunits. However, these combinations would be ordered such that adding smaller repunits increases the number by smaller increments. For example, R₄ = 1111, then R₄ + R₁ = 1112, R₄ + R₂ = 1122, R₄ + R₁ + R₂ = 1123, R₄ + R₃ = 1222, etc. Each of these is larger than R₄ but smaller than R₅.\n",

    "Looking at this, the sequence is generated by treating each repunit as a new \"digit\" that can be either included or excluded. Each time a new repunit is introduced, all previous numbers can be combined with the new repunit to form new numbers. The key is that each new repunit is significantly larger than the previous ones, so the numbers that include it are all larger than those that don't. However, when combined with smaller repunits, those numbers will interleave with the numbers formed by the next repunit. Wait, but in the example above, after R₃ (111), the numbers that include R₃ are 111, 112, 122, 123, which are followed by R₄ (1111). Then the numbers with R₄ are 1111, 1112, 1122, etc. So each new repunit introduces a block of numbers starting with the repunit itself, followed by the repunit plus all possible combinations of smaller repunits.

Therefore, a₄₈ is the (48 - 31) = 17th element in block 6. Similarly, block 6 is formed by adding R₆ to all subsets of R₁ to R₅. The subsets of R₁ to R₅ correspond to the sequence a₁ to a₃₁.

Block 7 elements are R₇ + aₘ where m ranges from 1 to 63 (the elements of blocks 1-6). Wait, but block 7 should have 64 elements (2⁶), which is adding R₇ to all subsets of R₁ to R₆. The subsets of R₁ to R₆ correspond to the numbers a₁ to a₆₃. Therefore, the elements of block 7 are R₇ + a₁, R₇ + a₂, ..., R₇ + a₆₃, ordered by their numerical value. However, the numbers a₁ to a₆₃ are already in increasing order, so adding R₇ to each preserves the order. Therefore, block 7 is simply [R₇ + a₁, R₇ + a₂, ..., R₇ + a₆₃]. Therefore, the 48th element in block 7 is R₇ + a₄₈.\n",

So a₄₈ is the 48th element overall, but since block 6 starts at a₃₂, the position within block 6 is 48 - 31 = 17th element. Therefore, the 17th element in block 6 is R₆ + a₁₇. Then a₁₇ is the 17th element in the entire sequence. But the total up to block 5 is 31, so a₁₇ is in block 5. Block 5 is [R₅, R₅ + a₁, R₅ + a₂, ..., R₅ + a₁₅]. Block 5 has 16 elements (a₁₆ to a₃₁). So a₁₇ is the second element in block 5: R₅ + a₁. Since a₁ is 1, so R₅ + 1 = 11111 + 1 = 11112. Thus, a₁₇ = 11112. Therefore, a₄₈ = R₆ + 11112 = 111111 + 11112 = 122223.

    "Therefore, a₁₁₁ is 1233334. But let's check whether this approach is correct. The key assumption here is that each block k corresponds to adding Rₖ to all previous subsets, and that the ordering of the entire sequence is simply the concatenation of these blocks. However, this might not be the case because when you add Rₖ to a subset, the resulting number might not necessarily be larger than all previous numbers without Rₖ. Wait, but since Rₖ is significantly larger than all previous repunits combined, any number including Rₖ will be larger than all numbers without Rₖ. For example, R₄ = 1111, which is larger than the sum of R₁ + R₂ + R₃ = 123. Therefore, all numbers in block 4 (which include R₄) are larger than all numbers in blocks 1-3. Similarly, R₅ is larger than all previous numbers, so block 5 numbers are all larger than blocks 1-4, etc. Therefore, the initial assumption holds: each block k is a contiguous segment of the sequence, starting at position 2^{k-1}, and the elements within each block are ordered by the sum of Rₖ with the subsets of previous repunits, which themselves are ordered. Therefore, the entire sequence is ordered by blocks, each block corresponding to a new repunit, and within each block, the numbers are ordered according to the subsets of the previous repunits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the method of calculating a₁₁₁ as R₇ + a₄₈ is valid, provided that the previous terms are correctly calculated. But since we can see that each step involves breaking down the index recursively, perhaps there's a pattern here similar to binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, since each number in the sequence corresponds to a unique subset of repunits, and each subset can be represented by a binary number where each bit represents the presence of a repunit, then the sequence aₙ is analogous to binary counting, but with each bit position having the value of a repunit instead of a power of 2. Therefore, the nth term can be found by taking the binary representation of n, and for each bit set in binary n, add the corresponding repunit.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the problem is that the ordering of the sums doesn't correspond to the binary counting order. For example, in binary, 3 is 11, which would correspond to R₁ + R₂ = 1 + 11 = 12, which is a₃. Similarly, 4 is 100 in binary, which would correspond to R₃ = 111, which is a₄. So in this case, the nth term corresponds to the sum of repunits where the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of n indicate which repunits to include. Therefore, aₙ is the sum of R_i for each i where the ith bit (starting from the least significant bit) in n's binary representation is 1.\n",

For example, if we have two subsets S and T where S < T, does Rₖ + S < Rₖ + T always hold? Yes, because Rₖ is a positive number. Therefore, adding Rₖ preserves the order. Therefore, the block method is correct in that the elements within each block are ordered by Rₖ + S, where S is in the previous order.

But according to the binary method, a₄₈ is the sum of repunits corresponding to binary 48. Let's check:\n",
    "\n",
    "48 in binary is 110000. Which is bits 5 and 4 set (from the right, starting at 0). Wait, 48 divided by 2 is 24 r0, 24/2=12 r0, 12/2=6 r0, 6/2=3 r0, 3/2=1 r1, 1/2=0 r1. So binary 110000. Therefore, bits 5 and 4 are set (positions 5 and 4). Therefore, according to the binary method, a₄₈=R₅ + R₆=11111 +111111=122222. But according to the block method, a₄₈=122223. There's a discrepancy here.\n",

    "\n",
    "This suggests that the block method's assumption that the elements of block k are Rₖ + aₘ for m from 1 to 2^{k-1}-1 is incorrect. Because when you add Rₖ to a previous aₘ, the sum might not correspond to the sum of the repunits as indicated by the binary representation of m + 2^{k-1}. Therefore, the block method incorrectly assumes that the order of the sums Rₖ + aₘ corresponds to the order of the binary representations, but this is not the case.\n",

    "Hence, the binary method is the correct one, and the block method is flawed in its assumption. The key insight is that each number in the sequence corresponds uniquely to a subset of repunits, and the order of these subsets when interpreted as binary numbers (with each bit representing a repunit) corresponds to the numerical order of their sums. However, this is only true if each repunit is larger than the sum of all smaller repunits.\n",

    "Let's verify this condition. For the repunits, R₁=1, R₂=11, R₃=111, R₄=1111, etc. The sum of all previous repunits is Sₖ = R₁ + R₂ + ... + R_{k-1}. We need to check if Rₖ > S_{k-1}.\n",

    "Similarly, Rₖ is always greater than the sum of all previous repunits. Therefore, each repunit is larger than the sum of all smaller ones. Therefore, the numerical value of any subset of repunits that includes Rₖ is determined primarily by Rₖ, and the ordering of these subsets is equivalent to the binary ordering. In other words, the sequence aₙ is exactly the numbers formed by interpreting n's binary digits as indicators for which repunits to include, sorted numerically. However, since each repunit is larger than the sum of all previous, the numerical order of the subsets is exactly the same as the binary counting order. Therefore, the nth term in the sequence is indeed the sum of the repunits corresponding to the bits set in n's binary representation.\n",

    "But why did the block method give a different result? Because the block method incorrectly assumed that the sequence is built in blocks where each block is Rₖ plus previous terms, but in reality, the sequence is directly determined by the binary representation of n. The key reason is that the block method didn't account for the fact that the numbers are ordered not by blocks but by their numerical value, which, due to the repunit growth, corresponds to the binary order.

    "Therefore, the binary method consistently gives the correct results. Therefore, the mistake in the block method was due to incorrect recursive assumption that each block is Rₖ added to previous terms in the sequence order, but in reality, the sequence order is determined by the binary representation, which doesn't align with that block structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the correct value of a₁₁₁ is 1,223,456.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to cross-verify, let's compute the position of 1223456 in the sequence.

    "\n",
    "But wait, the problem statement says \"Compute a_{111}\". According to the binary method, this is 1,223,456. However, I need to confirm this with an alternative approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about this is that each repunit corresponds to a bit in a binary number, and the sequence a_n is the numbers formed by these bits, ordered numerically. Since each repunit is larger than the sum of all smaller repunits, the ordering is exactly the same as treating each repunit as a bit in a binary number.

    "Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum possible value of the largest element in a list of seven positive integers where the median is 4 and the mean is 10. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's recall what median and mean mean. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are seven numbers, the fourth one is the median. So the fourth number in the sorted list must be 4. That means the first three numbers are less than or equal to 4, and the last three are greater than or equal to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the average, so the sum of all seven numbers divided by 7 is 10. Therefore, the total sum of the numbers is 7 * 10 = 70. So, the seven numbers add up to 70.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to maximize the largest element in the list. To do that, we need to minimize the other numbers as much as possible because the larger the other numbers are, the smaller the largest one can be. But we have constraints: the median is 4, and all numbers are positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me structure this:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seven numbers in ascending order: a, b, c, d, e, f, g.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the median d = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize g, we need to minimize a, b, c, e, f. Since the numbers are positive integers, the smallest possible values for a, b, c are 1 each. Wait, but we have to ensure that the median is 4, so the fourth number is 4. So, the first three numbers can be at most 4, but to minimize them, they should be as small as possible. So yes, a, b, c can be 1 each. Let me check:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 4. Then the first four numbers are 1,1,1,4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the remaining three numbers e, f, g must be greater than or equal to 4. To maximize g, we need to minimize e and f as much as possible. But since the numbers are in ascending order, e must be at least 4, f at least e, and g at least f.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to minimize e and f, we can set them to the smallest possible value, which is 4. But wait, if e and f are 4, then the numbers would be 1,1,1,4,4,4,g. Then the sum is 1+1+1+4+4+4+g = 15 + g. The total sum needs to be 70, so 15 + g = 70 => g = 55. Is that possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but hold on, if e and f are 4, but the numbers must be non-decreasing. Since d is 4, e must be at least 4, so yes, e can be 4. Similarly, f can be 4, and g can be 55. But let's check if that's allowed. The numbers would be 1,1,1,4,4,4,55. That seems okay. The median is 4, the mean is (1+1+1+4+4+4+55)/7 = 70/7 = 10. So that works. So is 55 the maximum possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but maybe we can set e and f to higher numbers but still get a higher g? Wait, no. If we make e and f larger, that would take away from the total sum available for g, which would make g smaller. So to maximize g, e and f should be as small as possible. Therefore, 4 is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's check again. If we set e and f to 4, then the sum of the first six numbers is 1+1+1+4+4+4 = 15. Therefore, the last number would need to be 70 - 15 = 55. That seems correct. So the maximum possible value is 55. Wait, but let me verify this again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe the numbers after the median can be higher. Wait, but if we set e and f to higher numbers, then g would have to be lower. For instance, if we set e=5, f=5, then the sum of the first six numbers would be 1+1+1+4+5+5 = 17, so g would be 70 - 17 = 53, which is lower than 55. So yes, keeping e and f as low as possible gives the maximum g.\n",
    "\n",
    "But another thought: is there a requirement that the numbers after the median must be strictly increasing or something? No, they just have to be non-decreasing. So setting e and f to 4 is acceptable because they can be equal to the median. Therefore, 55 seems correct.\n",

    "First, let's recall what median and mean mean. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are seven numbers, the fourth one is the median. So the fourth number in the sorted list must be 4. That means the first three numbers are less than or equal to 4, and the last three are greater than or equal to 4.\n",

    "Our goal is to maximize the largest element in the list. To do that, we need to minimize the other numbers as much as possible because the larger the other numbers are, the smaller the largest one can be. But we have constraints: the median is 4, and all numbers are positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me structure this:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seven numbers in ascending order: a, b, c, d, e, f, g.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the median d = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize g, we need to minimize a, b, c, e, f. Since the numbers are positive integers, the smallest possible values for a, b, c are 1 each. Wait, but we have to ensure that the median is 4, so the fourth number is 4. So, the first three numbers can be at most 4, but to minimize them, they should be as small as possible. So yes, a, b, c can be 1 each. Let me check:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 4. Then the first four numbers are 1,1,1,4.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, to minimize e and f, we can set them to the smallest possible value, which is 4. But wait, if e and f are 4, then the numbers would be 1,1,1,4,4,4,g. Then the sum is 1+1+1+4+4+4+g = 15 + g. The total sum needs to be 70, so 15 + g = 70 => g = 55. Is that possible?\n",

But let's check if that's allowed. The numbers would be 1,1,1,4,4,4,55. That seems okay. The median is 4, the mean is (1+1+1+4+4+4+55)/7 = 70/7 = 10. So that works. So is 55 the maximum possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but maybe we can set e and f to higher numbers but still get a higher g? Wait, no. If we make e and f larger, that would take away from the total sum available for g, which would make g smaller. So to maximize g, e and f should be as small as possible. Therefore, 4 is correct.\n",

    "But let's check again. If we set e and f to 4, then the sum of the first six numbers is 1+1+1+4+4+4 = 15. Therefore, the last number would need to be 70 - 15 = 55. That seems correct. So the maximum possible value is 55. Wait, but let me verify this again.\n",

So yes, keeping e and f as low as possible gives the maximum g.\n",
    "\n",

If a is 1, then b is 19, y is at least 9, but y can be between 9 and 19. Wait, but y is the fourth element, so y ≤ b. So, y can be from 9 to b.

Not necessarily. For example, y and b could be equal. But since the list is sorted, y ≤ b, so if y = b, then the last two elements are both b. But in that case, the mode would be 8 and b. Since 8 appears twice and b appears twice, so there would be two modes, which contradicts the given that mode is 8. Therefore, y and b cannot be equal.

Also, the sum is a +8 +8 +8 +b =24 +a +b =60, so a +b =36. And since b =a +18, substituting into a +b =36 gives a + (a +18) =36 → 2a +18 =36 → 2a =18 → a=9. But a=9, then b=27. However, in this case, the list would be 9,8,8,8,27. But wait, the list must be in non-decreasing order. If a=9, the first element is 9, but then the second element is 8, which is less than 9. That's not possible because the list is supposed to be sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, this case is invalid. So, three 8s would require that a ≤8 and b ≥8, but also in sorted order. If we have three 8s, then the first number a must be ≤8, and the last number b must be ≥8. However, if the first three numbers are 8, then the list would be 8,8,8, y, b. But then the median is 8, which is okay, but the range is b -8=18, so b=26. Then, the sum would be 8+8+8+y+26=50 +y=60, so y=10. So, the list would be 8,8,8,10,26. In this case, the mode is 8 (appears three times), median is 8, mean is (8+8+8+10+26)/5=60/5=12, range is 26-8=18. So this works. So, this is a valid case.

No, if there are three 8s, since the median is the third element, which is 8, then the first two elements can be less than or equal to 8, and the last two can be greater than or equal to 8. However, to have three 8s, the three middle elements must be 8. For example, the list could be a,8,8,8,b. But in order for this to be sorted, a must be ≤8 and b must be ≥8. However, if a <8, then the first element is a <8, the next three are 8, and the last is b. For example, a=7, then b=7 +18=25. Then, the sum would be 7 +8+8+8+25=56. But 56 is less than 60. Wait, but according to the sum equation, a +b +24=60 ⇒ a +b=36. Since b=a +18, then a + (a +18)=36 ⇒ 2a +18=36 ⇒ 2a=18 ⇒ a=9. But a=9 would mean the first element is 9, which is greater than 8, conflicting with the sorted order because the next three elements are 8. So, that's invalid. Therefore, the only possible way for three 8s is if a=8, leading to b=26, as above. Then, the fourth element is 10. So, that's the only configuration with three 8s.\n",

    "Wait, but let me check once more if there are any other possibilities. For example, in the two 8s case, when a=3, y=20, b=21. So, the second largest is 20, and the largest is 21. If instead, y is less than b, but in that case, since y=20 and b=21, the second largest is 20. Similarly, in all cases, y is exactly 26 -2a, and b is a +18. Since 26 -2a = y, and a +18 = b. So, y = b - (a +18) + (26 -2a). Wait, no, substitution shows that y =26 -2a, and b =a +18. Therefore, the difference between b and y is (a +18) - (26 -2a)=3a -8. For a=3: 3*3 -8=1 ⇒ y=20, b=21 ⇒ difference 1. For a=4:3*4 -8=4 ⇒ y=18, b=22 ⇒ difference 4. So, y and b are different numbers, so in all cases, the second largest is y, which is unique for each a.\n",

    "Okay, so I need to figure out the largest possible integer in this list of five positive integers with certain conditions. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's recall the properties given:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The only integer that occurs more than once is 8. That means 8 must appear at least twice, and all other numbers in the list must be unique. So, in the list of five numbers, two of them are 8, and the other three are distinct numbers different from each other and from 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The median is 9. Since the list has five numbers, the median is the third number when they're arranged in order. So, when sorted from smallest to largest, the middle number (the third one) is 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The average (mean) is 10. The sum of all five numbers must be 5 * 10 = 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find the largest possible integer that could be in the list. That would be the fifth number when the list is sorted. Let me try to structure this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the five numbers in ascending order as: a, b, c, d, e.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the median is 9, so c = 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 8 is the only number that repeats, and it must appear at least twice. But in the list a, b, c, d, e, we already have c=9. So the two 8s must be among a, b, and possibly one more. But wait, since the list is sorted, if there are two 8s, they need to be in the first two positions or one in the first and one in the second, but since the median is 9, the third position is fixed at 9. Let me think.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two 8s, then they have to be in the first two positions, because once we sort the list, the third is 9. So if 8 is in the list twice, then a = 8 and b = 8. Then c=9, and d and e are distinct numbers greater than or equal to 9, but since all numbers except 8 are unique, d and e must be greater than 9 and different from each other. Also, a and b are both 8, so the two duplicates are accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, hold on. The problem says \"the only integer in the list that occurs more than once is 8\". So, all other numbers must occur exactly once. That means, in the list, there are two 8s, and the other three numbers must each be unique and different from 8. So, when sorted, the list could be [8, 8, 9, d, e], where d and e are distinct integers greater than 9 (since the median is 9, so the third term is 9, so the fourth and fifth must be at least 9, but since they come after 9 in the sorted list, they must be greater than or equal to 9. However, 8 is already used, and all other numbers must be unique. So d and e must be unique numbers greater than or equal to 9, but not equal to 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but 9 is already in the list once (as the median). So if d or e is 9, then 9 would occur twice, which violates the condition that only 8 occurs more than once. Therefore, d and e must be greater than 9, and also distinct from each other and from 8 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the list must be [8, 8, 9, d, e] where d and e are integers greater than 9, d ≠ e, d ≠ 8, d ≠9, e ≠8, e≠9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the sum of all five numbers is 50. So, 8 + 8 + 9 + d + e = 50. Let's compute that: 8 + 8 is 16, plus 9 is 25. So 25 + d + e = 50. Therefore, d + e = 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to maximize e, the largest number in the list. To maximize e, we need to minimize d, given that d and e are integers greater than 9, distinct, and d < e (since the list is sorted).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the minimal possible value for d is 10. But we need to check if d can be 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "If d is 10, then e would be 25 - 10 = 15. But we need to ensure that all numbers are distinct and meet the conditions. Let's check:\n",
    "\n",
    "List would be [8, 8, 9, 10, 15]. All numbers except 8 are unique. 8 occurs twice, others once. That's okay. The median is 9, the average is (8+8+9+10+15)/5 = 50/5 =10. So that works. So e can be 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, maybe we can make e larger by making d even smaller? But d has to be greater than 9, right? Because in the sorted list, after the median 9, the next number d must be at least 10. Wait, the numbers after the median must be greater than or equal to the median. Since the median is 9, d and e can be 9 or higher. But in our case, since 9 is already used once, and we can't have duplicates except for 8, d and e must be at least 10. Because if d were 9, then we would have two 9s, which is not allowed. So d must be at least 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the minimal possible d is 10, which would make e 15. However, maybe there's another way to arrange the numbers? Let me think again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, perhaps the two 8s are not both in the first two positions. For example, maybe one 8 is in the first position, and the other 8 is somewhere else? But since the list is sorted, if there are two 8s, they have to be adjacent in the sorted list. Wait, no. Let me see.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the list is sorted, then duplicates must be adjacent. So if there are two 8s, they must be in consecutive positions. However, the median is 9, which is the third number. Therefore, the third number is 9, so the two 8s can't be after the third position. So the two 8s must be in the first two positions, right? Because otherwise, if one 8 is in the first position, and the other is in the second, that's okay. But if one 8 is in the first position and the other is in the third position, that would mean 8 is the median, but the median is 9, so that's impossible. So the two 8s have to be in positions 1 and 2. Therefore, the list is [8, 8, 9, d, e].\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, d and e must be at least 10 and distinct. So the minimal d is 10, which gives e =15. But wait, maybe we can have a higher e if d is 11, then e would be 14. But then e is 14, which is less than 15. So to maximize e, we need to minimize d. Therefore, the minimal d is 10, leading to e=15.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but let me check another possibility. What if the two 8s are not in the first two positions? Wait, but the list is sorted, so if there's an 8 in the third position, that would make the median 8, which contradicts the given median of 9. Similarly, if an 8 is in the fourth or fifth position, that would mean there's an 8 after 9 in the sorted list, which would require the first two positions to be less than or equal to 8, but since we need two 8s, they would have to be in positions 1 and 2. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sorted list of five numbers: a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the median c is 9, so a and b are ≤9, and d and e are ≥9.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we have two 8s. Since 8 is less than 9, the two 8s must be in the first two positions, because otherwise, if one 8 is in a position after the median, that would mean that number is ≥9, but 8 is less than 9, which is impossible. Therefore, the two 8s must be a and b. Therefore, the list is [8, 8, 9, d, e], with d and e ≥9, distinct, different from 8 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, d and e must be integers greater than or equal to 10, distinct from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the sum of the list is 8 + 8 + 9 + d + e = 25 + d + e =50, so d + e=25.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize e, set d as small as possible. The smallest possible d is 10, which gives e=15. Then check if all numbers are distinct: 8,8,9,10,15. Yes, duplicates only at 8, others unique. This works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but let me check another possibility. If d is 11, then e=14. Then the list is [8,8,9,11,14]. The sum is still 50. But e=14 is smaller than 15, so 15 is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "If d is 12, e=13. e=13 is even smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, 15 seems the maximum possible. But let's check if d=10 is allowed. Since d must be at least 10, and 10 is allowed. Then e=15. So, is there any problem with that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, all numbers must be positive integers. 15 is a positive integer. So that works.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, let me check if there's another arrangement where the two 8s are not both in the first two positions. For example, maybe one 8 is in the first position, and another 8 is in the fourth position. But wait, in a sorted list, that's impossible. If the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, then all duplicates must be grouped together. So if there's an 8 in the fourth position, then all previous positions must be ≤8. But since we have two 8s, the first two positions would have to be 8, making the third position 9, then the fourth and fifth positions would have to be ≥9. But 8 is less than 9, so you can't have an 8 after 9 in the sorted list. Therefore, the two 8s must be before the median. Therefore, they have to be in positions 1 and 2. So the list is necessarily [8,8,9,d,e].\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, that structure is fixed. So the maximum possible e is 15. But let me check another thing. Suppose we have different numbers in a and b. Wait, but the problem says the only integer that occurs more than once is 8. So if a and b are both 8, that's okay. If, for example, a was 7 and b was 8, then we could have another 8 somewhere else. Wait, but no, because if a is 7 and b is 8, then the other 8 would have to be in position c, d, or e. But c is 9, so can't be 8. d and e are ≥9, so can't be 8. Therefore, the only way to have two 8s is if both a and b are 8. Otherwise, we can't have two 8s. So that structure is indeed fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the list must be [8,8,9,d,e] with d ≥10, e ≥d+1, and d + e =25. So the minimal d is 10, leading to e=15. Let me confirm this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum: 8+8+9+10+15=50. Check. Median is 9. Check. Only duplicates are the two 8s. Check. All other numbers are distinct. Check. The largest number is 15. So that seems to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but wait a second. Is 10 the minimal possible d? What if d is 9? Then e would be 16. But d is supposed to be after the median, which is 9, so d has to be at least 9. However, if d is 9, then we would have two 9s in the list (the median and d). But the problem states that the only integer that occurs more than once is 8. So we can't have two 9s. Therefore, d cannot be 9. So the minimal d is 10. So e=15 is the maximum possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let me check if there is another way to structure the list. For example, if instead of having two 8s at the start, perhaps one 8 is at the start and another 8 is somewhere else? But as I thought earlier, in a sorted list, that's impossible. Let me think again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the list is [8, x, 9, y, z], where x is another 8. Then x has to be ≤9 (since it's the second element), so x=8. Then y and z are ≥9. Then the list would be [8,8,9,y,z], same as before. Alternatively, if the two 8s are not consecutive, but in a sorted list, duplicates have to be consecutive. So the two 8s have to be the first two elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe the two 8s are not both at the beginning. For example, could we have [x, 8, 9, 8, z]? But that's not sorted. If we sort it, it becomes [x,8,8,9,z] which would make the median 8, contradicting the given median of 9. Therefore, that's impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the two 8s must be the first two elements, and the rest are sorted in non-decreasing order. So the structure is fixed as [8,8,9,d,e].\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, d and e have to be two distinct integers greater than 9, summing to 25. To maximize e, minimize d. The minimal d is 10, giving e=15. If we choose d=11, then e=14; d=12, e=13, etc. So 15 is the maximum possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let me check if there's a way to have a larger e by having the two 8s not in the first two positions. Wait, but as established earlier, that's impossible because of the sorted order and the median being 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe if some numbers before the median are lower, allowing for a higher number at the end. Wait, but if the two 8s are in the first two positions, the third is 9, then d and e are after that. If we lower a or b, but they can't be lower than 8 because we need two 8s. Wait, no. Wait, a and b are both 8. So we can't make them smaller. So a and b are fixed at 8. Therefore, the first three numbers are 8,8,9. Then d and e have to be at least 10, sum to 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, unless there's another number that can be placed in the d or e position which is smaller than 10, but that's not possible because the numbers after the median must be greater than or equal to the median. Since the median is 9, d and e must be at least 9. But 9 is already used once, and duplicates are not allowed except for 8. So d and e must be at least 10 and unique. Therefore, the minimal d is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, unless we can have one of them as 9, but that would duplicate the median, which is not allowed. So, no. So d and e must be at least 10. Therefore, d=10, e=15 is the only way to maximize e.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let me check another angle. Suppose we have a different structure where one of the 8s is not in the first two positions. For example, could we have [x,8,9,8,e], but then when sorted, this would become [x,8,8,9,e], which would make the median 8, which contradicts the given median of 9. Therefore, impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if we have two 8s after the median. For example, [x, y,9,8,8]. But when sorted, this would be [x, y,8,8,9], which is not possible because 8 is less than 9, so the sorted list would have the two 8s before the 9. Hence, the median would be 8, which again contradicts the given median of 9. Therefore, the two 8s must be before the median. Therefore, in the sorted list, the first two elements are 8, the third is 9, then the other two are 10 or higher.\n",

    "Therefore, the structure is fixed. Therefore, the maximum e is 15.\n",

    "\n",
    "Is there a way to have a larger e? Let's see. If we could decrease the sum of the other numbers, we could increase e.
